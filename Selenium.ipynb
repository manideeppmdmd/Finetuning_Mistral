hey friends I'm Aliena and welcome back to  my channel so in the past four months or so   5.52 - I finished another Google certificate course  and this one it is the digital marketing and   11.22 - e-commerce certificate I took this course because  I work in the e-commerce industry so for those of   17.04 - you who consider taking the course I want to  break down what is exactly in these courses   21.9 - and I want to let you know whether I think it  is worth it or not first of all this is a large   27.96 - certificate course it's not just one certificate  it also has seven smaller certificates so there   33.48 - are seven courses in total you can also just take  one course and then get that certificate and it's   39.9 - not a course that you can finish in one sitting  you need to plan to spend months on the courses   45.96 - to finish everything there will be videos readings  quizzes and activities you'll be doing throughout   53.46 - the courses if you can pay for the course I will  recommend you to pay for the Coursera plus plan   60.18 - because that one you can not only take this  course you can take also any other course in   65.76 - coursera whenever there's a sale going on I'll be  putting the link to my description if you cannot   72.3 - afford the course no worries at all you can audit  it for free or you can apply for a financial aid   79.44 - let me quickly break down each course for you so  that you don't have to waste time thinking about   84.54 - which one should I take and which one should  I skip course one is about the fundamentals   89.76 - of digital marketing and e-commerce and by the  way digital marketing and e-commerce are two   94.86 - different things but this course just decide to  put them together and teach you at the same time   99.84 - so course one I would suggest everyone to take  because that's the fundamental it will run you   104.88 - through the digital marketing funnel it will  explain to you what is the difference between   109.62 - paid media versus owned media versus  earned media different types of ads   114.24 - SEO and then types of marketing campaign for  course 2 it's more heavily focused on SEO and   121.98 - ads so if you work in the industry related to  advertising or SEO this could be good for you   129.78 - course 3 is about social media marketing so if  you want to learn about social media marketing   134.28 - or do anything social media marketing related  take this one it also covers ads on social media   140.04 - advertising people you can check out the later  part of this course the fourth course is all   145.2 - about email marketing so if you get a job that's  highly related to email marketing take this course   151.32 - or if you want to learn about how to use email  to grow your small business take this course   157.08 - course five is about marketing or marketing  analysis and a little bit about Google ads   163.62 - this course is slightly more technical you will  see a lot of data and dashboard so for those of   171.84 - you that like numbers data analysis take this  one course six is about starting an e-commerce   178.56 - store especially on Shopify and it also touches  a little bit on advertising so if you want to   184.56 - start a Shopify store yourself or if you want to  learn more about e-commerce* and ads take this   189.72 - course and finally course 7 is about customer  loyalty how to write a great resume so if you   197.34 - want to get a job take this course now regarding  what I liked about the course first of all the   205.26 - breadth of the course was mind-blowing I feel  like I learned so many different things because   210.42 - I've also taken other Coursera Google courses  right like the ux design one data analysis one   215.4 - and the PM course from Google those are more  specific designed for one type of job but this   222.12 - course brought your knowledge about the entire  industry I definitely feel like I've learned a lot   229.08 - and just like what Google always does the video  quality is really good I really enjoy looking at   236.34 - high quality video and short videos so most of  the things are like five minutes long it's just   242.34 - way better than listen to a lecture for three  hours so for that part I highly enjoyed another   250.32 - thing that Google and Coursera really do well is  that they'll bring interactive activity in this   256.14 - learning process so even if the video is just five  minutes long you'll still see questions popping   261.66 - up in the middle of the video that test your  knowledge on what you just saw and this course   266.34 - brings you a lot of great resources either it is  links to things that you can learn deeper on or   273.12 - it's just like layouts of different job titles in  this industry other than that there's also a lot   279.9 - of practice in the course Coursera and Google  always bring good activity good scenarios so   286.68 - make sure you read through those scenarios don't  skip the activity those are really really spot on   291.72 - now moving to what I disliked about the course  as I said before I think the course touches on   298.14 - many many things it kind of made me feel like the  knowledge is a little bit scattered so I almost   304.86 - will suggest you to take the first course and then  directly jump to the one that you want to learn   310.5 - the most and after that you can just take your  time and look through the other videos for example   316.26 - if you only want to learn about email marketing  I'm not sure whether going through all the details   321.72 - about like ads* dashboards Google ads will help  you too much another thing that I kind of disliked   328.8 - is that they mixed together digital marketing  and e-commerce too much that I forgot to think   333.42 - about oh there's actually a difference between  digital marketing and e-commerce I work in the   338.04 - e-commerce industry because I work for eBay but  at the same time me doing YouTube channel is some   344.46 - sort of digital marketing for myself and I somehow  want to separate the concept a bit more you know   350.94 - so when you're taking the course please keep in  mind that even though the brand digital marketing   355.56 - and e-commerce together it's still not entirely  the same and finally I want to say that I don't   362.22 - think this certificate will help you too much if  your goal is to start an e-commerce store yourself   366.84 - because this course is more on the knowledge side  of thing instead of the practice side of thing   372.9 - if you want to start an e-commerce store  you will have to import you will have to   377.52 - take photos check the price communicate  with the buyers and that I think really   383.22 - need practice instead of just pure knowledge  but if your goal is to work in the digital   389.82 - marketing or e-commerce industry or if  you already got a job in these industries   396.12 - I think this is a great place for you to be it  just brings you so much knowledge you can talk   400.14 - about in those interviews but again knowledge is  different from experience to get an actual job   407.22 - you still need to show you have experience just by  showing you have a certificate will almost never   412.62 - get you a job and final advice for every single  one of you the best way of finishing anything   419.34 - certificate course related* or learn anything is  to dedicate 30 minutes every day that is my only   424.92 - strategy of finishing all these certificates  in this year and I do not regret taking any   430.5 -
