It’s a state park now? The government owns it? Well, there you go. 139.88 - Now, railroads didn’t create the desire to settle the west but they did make it possible for people who wanted to live out west to do so, for two reasons. 146.88 - First, without railroads there would be no way to bring crops or other goods to market. 151.48 - I mean, I guess you could dig a canal across Kansas, but, if you’ve ever been to Kansas that is not a tantalizing proposition. 156.74 - Second, railroads made life in the west profitable and livable because they brought the goods that people needed, 162.02 - such as tools for planting and sowing, shoes for wearing, books for putting on your shelf and pretending to have read. 168.54 - Railroads allowed settlers to stay connected with the modernity that was becoming the hallmark of the industrialized world in the 19th century. 174.36 - Now, we saw last week that the Federal government played a key role in financing the transcontinental railroad, but state governments got into the act too, often to their financial detriment. 182.26 - In fact, so many states nearly went bankrupt financing railroads that most states now have constitutional requirements that they balance their budgets. 188.96 - But perhaps the central way that the Federal government supported the railroads, and western settlement and investment in general, 194.54 - was by leading military expeditions against American Indians, rounding them up on ever-smaller reservations, and destroying their culture. 201.76 - Let’s go to the Thought Bubble. 203.04 - There was an economic as well as a racial imperative to move the Native Americans off their land: white people wanted it. 209.18 - Initially it was needed to set down railroad tracks, and then for farming. 212.34 - But eventually it was also exploited for minerals like gold and iron and other stuff that makes industry work. 217.66 - I mean, would you really want a territory called the Badlands unless it had valuable minerals? 222.44 - Early western settlement, of the Oregon Trail kind, did not result in huge conflicts with Native Americans, 226.92 - but by the 1850s, a steady stream of settlers kicked off increasingly bloody conflicts that lasted pretty much until 1890. 233.6 - Even though the fighting started before the Civil War, the end of the “war between the states” 237.56 - meant a new, more violent phase in the warring between American Indians and whites. 241.86 - General Philip H. “Little Phil” Sheridan set out to destroy the Indians’ way of life, 246.06 - burning villages and killing their horses and especially the buffalo that was the basis of the plains tribes’ existence. 251.48 - There were about 30 million buffalo in the  U.S. in 1800; by 1886 the Smithsonian Institute had difficulty finding 25 “good specimens.” 259.76 - In addition to violent resistance, some Indians turned to a spiritual movement to try to preserve their traditional way of life. 265.22 - Around 1890 the Ghost Dance movement arose in and around South Dakota. 269.38 - Ghost Dancers believed that if they gathered together to dance and engage in religious rituals, 273.62 - eventually the white man would disappear and the buffalo would return, and with them the Indians’ traditional customs. 279.56 - But even though a combined force of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors completely destroyed George Custer’s force of 250 cavalrymen at Little Bighorn in 1876, 287.82 - and Geronimo took years to subdue in the Southwest, western Native Americans were all defeated by 1890, and the majority were moved to reservations. 295.6 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. Boy, this Wild West episode sure is turning out to be loads of fun! 299.76 - It’s just like the Will Smith movie! 301.28 - All right, Stan, this is about to get even more depressing, so let’s look at, like, some pretty mountains and western landscapes and stuff, while I deliver this next bit. 308.26 - So in 1871 the U.S. government ended the treaty system that had since the American Revolution treated Native American land as if they were nations. 316.52 - And then with the Dawes Act of 1887, the lands set aside for the Indians were allotted to individual families rather than to tribes. 324.0 - Indians who “adopted the habits of civilized life,” 327.2 - which in this case meant becoming small scale individualistic Jeffersonian farmers, 331.62 - would be granted citizenship and there were supposed to be some protections  to prevent their land from falling out of Native American possession. 337.78 - But, these protections were not particularly protective and much of the Indian land was purchased either by white settlers or by speculators. 343.72 - After the passage of the Dawes Act “Indians lost 86 million of the 138 million acres of land in their possession.” 350.12 - Oh boy, it’s time for the Mystery Document. The rules here are simple. 354.64 - I guess the author of the Mystery Document. And then you get to see me get shocked when  I’m wrong. All right. 360.08 - I have seen the Great Father Chief the Next Great Chief the Commissioner Chief; the Law Chief; 365.56 - and many other law chiefs and they all say they are my friends, and that I shall have justice, 371.22 - but while all their mouths talk right I do not understand why nothing is done for my people. 376.74 - I have heard talk and talk but nothing is done Words do not pay for my dead people. 382.56 - They do not pay for my country now overrun by white men. 386.04 - They do not protect my father's grave. 388.48 - Good words will not give my people a home where they can live in peace and take care of themselves. 393.7 - I am tired of talk that comes to nothing. 396.22 - It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and all the broken promises. 401.1 - I mean that could be almost any American Indian leader. 403.63 - This is totally unfair, Stan. All I really know about this is that the Great Father Chief is the President. 407.46 - I mean it could be any of a dozen people. 409.04 - How bout if I say the name in 10 seconds I don’t get punished? 411.58 - Aaaand start. Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo, Chief Big Foot, um, Keokuk, Chief Oshkosh, 418.54 - Chief Joseph Ch-OH YES YES! 421.4 - And now let us move from tragedy to tragedy. 424.36 - So if you’re thinking that it couldn’t get worse for the Native Americans: it did. 428.26 - After killing off the buffalo, taking their land and forcing Indians onto reservations, 432.8 - the Bureau of Indian Affairs instituted a policy that amounted to cultural genocide. 437.36 - It set up boarding schools, the most famous of which was in Carlisle, PA, where Indian children were forcefully removed from their families to be civilized. 445.42 - This meant teaching them English, taking away their clothes, their names, and their family connections. 450.42 - The idea put succinctly, was to “kill the Indian, save the man.” 454.6 - Now, the U.S. wasn’t the only nation busy subjugating its indigenous inhabitants and putting them on reservations in the late 19th century. 460.16 - Like, something similar was happening in South Africa, in Chile, and even to First Peoples in Canada. 465.34 - And you’re usually so good, Canada. 466.98 - Although the slower pace of western settlement meant  that there was much less bloodshed, so, another point to Canada. 472.28 - And as bad as the American boarding school policy was, 475.08 - at least it was short lived compared with Australia’s policy of removing Aboriginal children from families and placing them with  white foster families, which lasted until the 1970s. 483.88 - All right, Stan, we need to cheer this episode up. Let’s talk about cowboys! 487.2 - The Marlboro Man riding the range, herding cows and smoking, solitary in the saddle, alone in his emphysema. 494.36 - Surely that is the actual West, the men and women but mostly men who stood apart from the industrializing country as the last of Jefferson’s rugged individuals. 503.6 - But, no. Once again, we have the railroad to thank for our image of the cowboy. 508.4 - Like, those massive cattle drives of millions of cows across open range Texas? 513.02 - Yeah, they ended at towns like Abilene, and Wichita, and Dodge City – because that’s where the railheads were. 518.74 - Without railroads, cowboys would have just driven their cattle in endless circles. 522.52 - And without industrial meat processing, there wouldn’t have been a market for all that beef. 527.04 - And it was a lot of beef. You know what I’m talking about. I’m actually talking about beef. 531.68 - By the mid 1880s the days of open range ranching were coming to an end, 535.84 - as ranchers began to enclose more and more land and set up their businesses closer to, you guessed it, railroad stations. 541.87 - There are also quite a few things about western farming that just fly in the face of the mythical Jeffersonian yeoman farmer ideal. 548.56 - Firstly, this type of agricultural work was a family affair; 552.38 - many women bore huge burdens on western farms, as can be seen in this excerpt from a farm woman in Arizona: 558.32 - “Get up, turn out my chickens, draw a pail of water … 560.76 - make a fire, put potatoes to cook, brush and sweep half inch of dust off floor, 565.12 - feed three litters of chickens, then mix biscuits, get breakfast, milk, besides work in the house and this morning had to go half mile after calves.” 573.56 - These family-run farms were increasingly oriented towards production of wheat and corn for national and even international markets rather than trying to eke out subsistence. 582.34 - Farmers in Kansas found themselves competing with farmers in Australia and Argentina, 587.16 - and this international competition pushed prices lower and lower. 590.7 - Secondly, the Great Plains, while remarkably productive agriculturally, wouldn’t be nearly as good for producing crops without massive irrigation projects. 598.14 - Much of the water needed for plains agriculture comes a massive underground lake, the Oglala Aquifer. 603.08 - Don’t worry, by the way, the Aquifer is fed by a magic and permanent H20 factory in the core of the earth that you can learn about in Hank’s show, Crash Course Chemis– 610.52 - What’s that? It’s going dry. MY GOD THIS IS A DEPRESSING EPISODE. 614.14 - Anyway, large-scale irrigation projects necessitate big capital investments, 618.16 - and therefore large, consolidated agricultural enterprises that start to look more like agri-business than family farms. 625.26 - I mean, by 1900, California was home to giant commercial farms reliant on irrigation and chemical fertilizers. 631.52 - Some of them were owned, not by families, but by big corporations like the Southern Pacific Railroad. 636.06 - And they were worked by migrant farm laborers from China, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico. 641.14 - As Henry George, a critic of late 19th century corporate capitalism, wrote 644.68 - “California is not a country of farms, but … of plantations and estates.” 648.7 - When studying American history, it’s really easy to get caught up in the excitement of industrial capitalism with its robber barons, 655.0 - and new technologies, and fancy cities because that world looks very familiar to us, probably because it’s the one in which we live. 661.68 - After all, if I was running a farm like that Arizona woman I talked about earlier, there’s no way I could be making these videos because I’d be chasing my calves. 668.26 - I don’t even know what a litter of chickens is. 670.08 - Is it 4 chickens? 12? 6? It’s probably 12 because eggs do come in dozens. 673.86 - The massive agricultural surplus contemporary farms create, 677.18 - and the efficient transportation network that gets that surplus to me quickly, makes everything else possible – from YouTube to Chevy Volts. 685.16 - And no matter who you are, you benefit from the products that result from that massive surplus. 689.44 - That’s why we’re watching YouTube right now. 691.44 - So, agriculture and animal husbandry did change a lot in late 19th century America, 695.44 - as we came to embrace the market driven ethos that we either celebrate or decry these days. 700.84 - And in the end, the Wild West ends up looking a lot more like industrial capitalism than like a Larry McMurtry novel. 706.68 - The Wild West, like the rest of the industrialized world, was incentivized to increase productivity and was shaped by an increasingly international economic system. 714.6 - And it’s worth remembering that even though we think of the Oregon Trail and the Wild West being part of the same thing. 719.56 - In fact, they were separated by the most important event in American history: the Civil War. 723.62 - I know that ain’t the mythologizing you’ll  find in Tombstone, but it is true. 727.36 - Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week. 729.47 - Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko. 733.6 - The associate producer of the show is Danica Johnson. 735.98 - The show is written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Halse Rojas, and myself. 740.12 - And our graphics team is Thought Café. 741.98 - Every week, there’s a new caption for the libertage. 743.66 - If you’d like to suggest one you can do so in comments where you can also ask questions about today’s video that will be answered by our team of historians. 749.34 - Thanks for watching Crash Course. If you enjoy it, make sure you subscribe. 752.36 - And as we say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome. 754.6 - OH, ahh I didn’t get a good push."}}

43.659 - Because if I show you the website 45.493 - where all these courses are listed. 47.44 - So you will see that 48.442 - the IIM Bangalore logo is on top of all of them. 50.746 - But not all these courses are offered by IIM Bangalore. 54.052 - For example, there is a course called 55.226 - 'Advanced Product Quality Planning'. 57.159 - On it, above the logo, it says 'Quality Council of India'. 60.794 - This means that even though 62.224 - IIM Bangalore is the national coordinator, 64.224 - this course is presented by the Quality Council of India  67.509 - or the people working there. 70.124 - Now, if you check the courses in this list, 72.47 - most of them are starting from the 15th of July. 75.847 - And if you check their registration dates, 77.882 - they are ending on different dates, 79.726 - but most of the registrations will close on 31st August. 83.502 - To apply for these courses, you don't have to pay any fee. 86.802 - They are 100% free when it comes to 89.221 - going through the material itself. 91.012 - However, if you want a certificate, 93.33 - you need to take an exam for it. 95.371 - And that exam is a paid exam. 97.699 - Now, what is the fee for that exam? 99.203 - For the general category, it is 750 rupees per exam, 101.744 - and for SC, ST, OBC, or PWD categories, 104.95 - it is 500 rupees per exam. 107.247 - Now let's address some questions that might be coming 110.749 - to your mind related to these courses or the exam. 113.827 - The first question is: who can pursue these courses? 117.02 - Any person from any age group, 119.281 - belonging to any category, 121.46 - with any educational background, 123.394 - from any state or anywhere can pursue them freely. 126.992 - If you are in India, you can also take the exam. 129.796 - If you are outside India, 131.512 - you won't be able to take the exam 133.182 - because the exam centers are only in India. 135.241 - The second question is: 136.236 - How many courses can you pursue at a time? 139.507 - Well, you can apply for as many courses as you like. 142.448 - But if you need to take their exams, 144.696 - you cannot take exams for more than 8 courses at a time. 148.506 - What is the reason for this? 149.716 - These exams are conducted in 2 slots over 4 days. 153.002 - This means that 4 specific dates will be chosen. 155.328 - And on each date, 156.365 - there will be a morning slot and an afternoon slot. 158.68 - So, in total, you can only take 8 exams. 162.162 - And that too only if those 8 courses 165.407 - are scheduled on 4 different dates. 167.874 - Next question: How do you register for these courses? 170.324 - You will see a \"Join\" button on the page of any course. 174.032 - From there, you can simply enroll by filling up your details. 177.766 - The next question is: Will the material be recorded or live? 181.811 - So every week, you will receive an email 184.046 - that new material has been added. 185.835 - New material will be uploaded on a weekly basis 188.564 - which will include videos, transcripts, 190.772 - and any documents they want to share with you. 194.246 - But all of these are already recorded. 196.281 - Nothing is live; you can access it freely at any time, 200.354 - but it will be updated weekly. 201.841 - When you receive weekly videos, 204.07 - you will also receive weekly assessments. 206.769 - The marks of these weekly assessments are important 209.693 - because they will count towards your final marks 212.184 - on which basis you will receive the certificate. 214.312 - One more thing to keep in mind is that the deadlines for 216.814 - these assignments or assessments are also important. 219.569 - If you don't complete them before the deadline, 222.592 - your marks will not be considered. 225.0 - The next question is: How do you register for the exam? 227.892 - When the course is complete, 229.719 - details about exams will be uploaded on the same page 233.458 - which is their homepage on Swayam. 235.319 - You will receive notifications about this in your email 238.469 - whenever the exam is announced. 239.9 - So don't worry about this. 241.221 - If you want to know tentative dates,  243.446 - the courses visible have some dates mentioned. 246.99 - It is 7th & 8th of December and 14th & 15th of December. 251.924 - Now comes the question of where will this exam be conducted? 255.257 - So the exam will be conducted 256.979 - at their centers in offline mode. 259.104 - Now, what is the list of those centers? 260.969 - When you register for the exam, it will appear there. 264.283 - But for reference based on last year, 266.483 - let me show you the list. 267.939 - Now, to obtain this certificate,  269.766 - what is the marking scheme that I was explaining earlier? 272.828 - You will either have weekly assessments 275.538 - or there will be a mid-term exam. 277.458 - And when it ends, there will be a final exam. 280.122 - The weightage for both is 25% and 75%. 284.322 - Now, to be eligible for the certificate, 286.964 - Your assessments, meaning your mid-term exam or 290.0 - weekly assessments, you need at least 40% marks. 292.879 - And you also need at least 40% marks in your final exam. 296.404 - Now, let me give you a list of some best courses. 299.254 - But before I share the names of those courses, 301.947 - let me also suggest you a very useful free tool that 305.429 - you can learn the practical application of these courses. 308.648 - If you look closely at these courses, 310.491 - many of them deal with management, data, and projects. 315.289 - To learn all these skills, 317.25 - you can use the Odoo's Project Management app. 320.833 - This first app is free forever 323.019 - with unlimited hosting and support. 324.931 - For example, I created a project for CAT aspirants 327.596 - called the CAT timetable. 329.765 - In this, I added different chapters in task form 333.175 - and then I created stages. 334.71 - So, if you want, you can move any task, 337.029 - meaning chapter, into different stages. 339.398 - You can change their status 340.855 - to record the progress of your project. 342.689 - You can also easily view it in this 'Kanban' view 345.663 - or you can use list view, chart view, table view, all of these. 349.418 - Within each task, you can also record the time spent 352.531 - through timesheets as well. 353.976 - Basically, this tool can help you visualize your project 357.135 - and manage your time more effectively 359.348 - while completing the tasks. 360.91 - So, I'll add the link to the CAT timetable and 362.928 - Odoo's Project Management app 365.118 - in the description and pinned comment. 367.212 - In case you would like to check them out. 368.85 - Now let's talk about those top courses 371.257 - that will add the most value to your resume. 374.47 - Now let me show you a sample certificate first 377.414 - to explain why it is important 379.144 - to choose these courses. 380.558 - So the first thing you should notice is that 383.075 - this certificate mentions name of your institute 386.727 - where professors or authorities must have taught you. 389.691 - That's why the courses I have picked 392.153 - are offered by top IIMs. 394.186 - Out of these, 9 courses are offered by IIM Bangalore  397.156 - and one course is offered by IIM Ahmedabad. 399.433 - I'm sharing the names of these courses one by one 402.35 - and showing their photographs on the screen 405.611 - so that you know which course to select. 408.82 - The 1st course is \"Banking and Financial Markets.\" 412.681 - 2.

56.61 - Well, you can actually do that without paying a single dollar right from the comfort of 60.719 - your home. 61.89 - This course is called CS50 and it’s available for free on Youtube. 65.059 - But what makes this course so special that 5 million students have watched it within 69.04 - the first 6 months of posting on Youtube? 70.92 - For starters, the course is taught by Professor David Malan, who has also been called the 75.009 - \"most popular professor at Harvard\". 76.71 - And let me tell you, this guy knows his stuff. 79.189 - We have one more course by him in our top 5 list today. 82.2 - So, stay tuned. 83.2 - The course is designed in a way that even beginners can easily follow along. 86.47 - It starts with the basics of programming using C, but it's not just about coding. 90.1 - CS50 teaches you how to think like a programmer, to break down problems and solve them using 94.259 - logic and critical thinking. 95.899 - And the best part about CS50 is the problem sets. 98.76 - These are weekly assignments that challenge you to put what you've learned into practice. 102.229 - They range from simple tasks like printing out \"Hello, world!\" 105.18 - to building your own search engine. 106.85 - If you have any doubts about whether you will be able to learn programming using this course, 110.219 - go checkout CS50 fairs where the students show off their final projects. 114.009 - From a virtual reality game to a machine learning algorithm, the projects are truly impressive. 118.369 - Link to this course and everything else I discuss today can be found in the description. 125.409 - The hardest part of mastering programming isn't the complexity of the programming itself, 129.33 - but staying consistent with your practice. 131.14 - You start off strong, excited to finish every exercise you can get your hands on, but then 135.379 - life gets in the way. 136.46 - And weeks go by without touching your code editor. 139.08 - We've all been there. 140.29 - To solve this problem, we have a course called “100 Days of Code” by Dr. Angela Yu. 144.86 - And it does exactly what it promises. 147.24 - It makes coding a part of your daily routine, even if it's just for one hour. 150.92 - That’s why I have included this course on my top 5 list even when this course is paid 155.08 - and very long. 156.08 - Btw, this is the only paid course on our list today. 158.909 - But how does this course make sure you stay consistent? 161.459 - This course provides daily coding challenges and real world projects that help you stay 165.25 - on track. 166.25 - Even though the main focus of this course is learning Python, it also introduces some 170.35 - other topics like Web Development and Data Science. 173.32 - As a beginner, it's important to explore different areas of programming to determine what you 177.239 - enjoy most. 178.55 - And you will get to do that with this course. 180.55 - But how much do you have to pay for this course? 182.61 - I have seen this course go for 19 dollars on Udemy and it comes with a 30 day money 186.599 - back guarantee. 187.64 - You can always check this course out and get your money back if you don’t like it. 193.799 - Once you have learnt programming, most of you might want to get paid to write code. 204.56 - One of the ways to make good money is to get a job as a programmer at a tech company. 208.69 - In order to do that, you have to go through coding interviews. 211.63 - And the questions asked in these coding interviews are very different from the skills you have 214.659 - learnt so far. 215.94 - Most of these questions are based on this one very famous course called Data Structures 219.05 - and Algorithms or DSA which is taught at most universities. 222.78 - Some people watching this video do not have a computer science degree like me. 226.269 - Many simply did not understand DSA well enough in college. 228.709 - For those people, we have this course called Algorithms by Princeton university. 233.129 - This course is divided into two parts and taught using Java. 236.659 - Professor Sedgewick, who is one of the instructors of this course, has been teaching Algorithms 240.3 - since the 1980s. 241.67 - He has even invented a few algorithms himself. 244.379 - The instructors of this course have seen many algorithms come and go during their careers. 248.489 - Their book on Algorithms has been a bestseller since the 1980s. 254.59 - This course covers a wide range of topics like sorting, searching, graph algorithms, 258.709 - dynamic programming, and more. 260.33 - Rather than focusing on specific algorithms in isolation, this course covers the fundamental 264.88 - concepts and techniques that make the basis of many important algorithms. 268.71 - This helps students to build a deep understanding of the subject that can be applied to a wide 272.44 - range of problems in the interviews. 274.16 - That’s what makes this course the best course on Data Structures and Algorithms. 278.19 - DSA requires a good understanding of Math which many of you might not have. 283.86 - Additionally, the DSA path gets you hired for generic positions and many people want 288.53 - to work in specialized jobs. 289.889 - One of the most popular specializations that has a very high demand is Web development. 294.69 - The biggest issue with learning web development is that this path is very long and most people 298.72 - lose track as they try to learn web development in an unstructured way. 302.66 - To solve this problem, I recommend Meta’s Front end developer professional certificate 306.87 - on Coursera. 307.87 - If you want the certificate, it will cost you around 270 US dollars. 311.88 - But there is an option to audit the courses and get them for free if you don’t care 315.93 - about the certificate. 317.19 - So why do I recommend this course? 319.03 - Well, the course is taught by the Meta staff who work in the industry and have a good understanding 323.34 - of the skills the tech industry is looking for. 325.69 - Meta is also the creator of React which is the most popular and the most in demand front 329.88 - end development library. 330.88 - So, you’ll learn the best practices in React through this course. 333.72 - This course is extremely comprehensive and covers everything you need to get an entry 337.09 - level job as a front end developer. 338.94 - It teaches the basics like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 342.199 - It also covers Bootstrap which is a very popular CSS framework. 345.22 - We already discussed React which is a popular Javascript library. 348.6 - You will also learn the basics of UI and UX design with Figma. 352.0 - The course ends with a separate section on Coding Interview preparation which is a must 355.28 - to land a job. 356.28 - I will link this course in the description. 359.78 - Everything that we have discussed so far can only get you to the level of junior developer. 364.28 - And there’s a big gap between a junior and a senior developer. 366.99 - That’s because a junior developer can simply write and push code for the bug that is assigned 371.21 - to them. 372.21 - But a senior developer has to make sure that the systems this code gets deployed to do 375.5 - not break down if this code is buggy. 378.289 - Additionally, they also need to ensure that the architecture of this system is designed 380.94 - in a way that it can handle a large number of user requests with low latency. 385.069 - Once again, let's turn to Professor Malan to help us understand how it's done. 389.08 - Now this one is not a full course per se, it’s just an introductory video on how to 392.93 - think about scalability. 394.4 - But it’s a great starting point because System Design can be quite overwhelming for 397.759 - some people. 398.759 - This video covers basics like horizontal scaling, load balancing and scaling. 402.389 - It also covers slight advanced concepts like data partitioning and security. 406.16 - If you are curious about what exactly happens in the time between you type a url and the 409.699 - website loads, you should definitely watch this course. 412.49 - Now you know all the different courses you can take to streamline your programming journey. 416.38 - But you still don’t know how to pick a roadmap that is personalized for your background. 419.98 - If you want me to help you with that, watch this video. 422.94 - My name is Sahil and I will see you in the next one."}}

I don’t have to say it all French-y. This is American history. 22.18 - And shut up French people about how if it weren’t for your support in the American Revolution, this would be the History of Southern Canada. 28.16 - But other revolutions, like the Industrial Revolution, actually change things. 31.6 - So, which was the American Revolution? 33.689 - Well, little of column A, little of Column B. 35.729 - Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Yeah, we went from a bunch of rich white guys running the show all the way to a bunch of rich white guys running the show. 41.36 - You’re not wrong, Me from the Past. 42.8 - But the 1700s were a pretty good century for rich white guys everywhere. 46.26 - I mean, they were running the show in Holland and Portugal and Spain, but only the United States became the country that invented baseball, the Model T, and competitive eating. 55.06 - So you’re right, Me from the Past, but even if the US didn’t live up to its rhetoric, that rhetoric was still powerful. 60.24 - And in the end whether you care more about ideas or policy defines whether you think the American Revolution really was Revolutionary. 66.82 - [Theme Music] 75.72 - All right, let’s start with the War for Independence. 77.36 - If you’ve been watching Crash Course, you’ll know that we’re not big on gratuitous war details. 81.08 - But we’re obligated to tell you something about it. 83.3 - The main strategy of the British in the Revolutionary war was to capture all the cities and force the colonists to surrender. 88.27 - And the first part of that strategy pretty much worked. 90.35 - They captured Boston and New York and Charleston, but all the colonists had to do was NOT QUIT. 95.4 - I mean, they had home-field advantage, knowledge of the terrain, easier supply lines, and Mr. Creepy Eyes down here. 100.92 - So while the British took the cities, the Americans, or Continentals, held onto the countryside. 104.72 - The most famous battle of the war was probably the battle of Trenton, where Washington was like, 108.24 - “I’m gonna cross the Delaware on Christmas morning.” 110.58 - He had a funny voice. Everybody knows he had a funny voice. It’s famous. 113.1 - That’s a made up fact! Don’t put it on your AP test. 115.78 - “What do I know about Washington? Well, I know he had a funny voice.” 118.84 - Washington surprised a bunch of Hessians, which was a pretty impressive victory especially since he had just come off of a string of defeats. 123.78 - But he wasn’t able to turn it into an all out rout, and ended up having to spend a miserable winter at Valley Forge. 128.22 - But remember, generals always get to eat. 130.64 - But the most important battle, at least in the North, was not Trenton, but Saratoga. 134.4 - This was a major defeat for the British, and while it’s often put forth as an example of the superiority of the Continental fighting man, the British mostly lost because of terrible generalling. 142.88 - The French would eventually bankrupt themselves helping us, which would lead to their own Revolution. 146.8 - As thanks, we named our most important food after them. 149.42 - In the South the country-city trend continued with the British taking Charleston but then continuing to lose smaller scale battles and be harassed by guerrilla style tactics. 156.7 - The key battle of the war in the south – because it was the one where the British surrendered – was at Yorktown in 1781. 162.18 - Lord Cornwallis made the brilliant tactical decision to station his troops on a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by water filled with French ships, and the British lost the war. 170.8 - So what did this all mean for actual people? 172.88 - Well, Americans like to think that we all pitched in together and got rid of British tyranny, and lived happily ever after. 178.48 - Also that the Continental army was the bravest, most loyal, and most effective fighting force in human history thanks to the leadership of George Washington. 186.68 - [Patriotic Rock Music] 191.04 - But actually, well, yeah, let’s go to the Thought Bubble. 194.78 - Morale among continental soldiers was often pretty low. 197.66 - Rations were poor and soldiers went unpaid. 200.48 - As Joseph Plumb Martin, a soldier from Connecticut, wrote, they felt they were, 203.98 - “starving in detail for an ungrateful people who did not care what became of us.” 209.01 - And many other colonists didn’t fight for independence; they fought with the British. 212.85 - Others were pacifists, like the Quakers, who often had their property confiscated when they refused to fight. 216.89 - And in colonial America, of course, losing property also meant losing rights. 220.84 - And for slaves, the so-called fight for freedom was very different than it was for Continental soldiers, because loyalty to Britain in the war could mean freedom. 228.98 - In 1775, British governor Lord Dunmore issued a proclamation that granted freedom to any slave who deserted his master and fought for the British. 236.4 - Something like 5,000 slaves took him up on the offer. 239.34 - And in addition, many slaves saw the revolution as chance to escape. 242.72 - Boston King left a cruel master and later wrote, 245.54 - “I determined to go to Charles-Town and throw myself into the hands of the English. 249.4 - They received me readily, and I began to feel the happiness of liberty, of which I knew nothing before.” 255.04 - 100,000 slaves are estimated to have fled to the British. 258.48 - Now, many slaves were returned to their masters, but more than 15,000 left the U.S. when the British did. 263.1 - And it’s worth remembering that the British empire abolished slavery in all of its territory by 1843 and without a civil war. 269.9 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. 271.08 - So, Native Americans were also profoundly affected by the Revolutionary War. 274.62 - Generally, they wanted to stay out of it, and the Colonists mostly wanted them to remain neutral, too. 278.76 - Like, the Continental Congress was eager to remind the Iroquois of their history of neutrality, writing: 283.06 - “This is a family quarrel between us and Old England. 286.0 - You Indians are not concerned in it. 287.94 - We don’t wish you to take up the hatchet against the king’s troops. 290.96 - We desire you to remain at home, and not join on either side, but keep the hatchet buried deep.” 297.28 - Right, well, many of the Iroquois fought for the British, anyway. 300.07 - The Oneidas joined the Patriots, fighting against the Iroquois. 302.84 - Sometimes there were divisions within tribes themselves. 305.11 - Like, with the Cherokees; younger chiefs tended to side with the British, older ones with the Americans. 309.66 - And it should be mentioned that, unsurprisingly, American troops were particularly brutal to American Indians who fought for the British, burning their villages and enslaving prisoners, contrary to the accepted rules of war. 320.34 - And, if the American revolution was really about, as Thomas Jefferson would have it, \"the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" then the Indians were definitely the losers because they didn’t get any of those rights. 330.99 - So, we know slaves and Indians didn’t get much out of the Revolutionary War. 334.27 - How did it go for women? Yeah, not great. 336.65 - Some colonial women fought in the war: 338.4 - Deborah Sampson dressed up as a man and fought at several battles, once even pulling a bullet out of her own leg. 343.5 - But women didn’t get much out of the Revolution – they were basically still considered wards of their husbands. 347.96 - Or, if they were unmarried, saleable assets of their fathers. 350.85 - However, the idea of Republican Motherhood became really important. 354.06 - It held that for the republic to survive, it was necessary to have a well-educated citizenry. 358.32 - And since women were the primary educators, they themselves needed to be educated so they could, to quote Founding Father Benjamin Rush, 364.889 - “instruct their sons in the principles of liberty and government.” 368.009 - But not vote or own property. 369.49 - So the war didn’t end slavery, it didn’t much change the roles of women. 372.85 - And it didn’t displace the elite, land-owning, pasty white guy leadership of America. 377.75 - So what was revolutionary? Well, the ideas. 380.18 - A lot of which are summed up in a single sentence of the Declaration of Independence: 383.44 - “We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” 395.28 - So, when the colonies became states, they all created constitutions, which opened voting to more people. 399.64 - While most states still had property qualifications for voting, the bar was lowered, so there were far more voters than there had been. 405.46 - Although they were mostly white and male, but still. 407.28 - Another aspect of the American revolution that was pretty revolutionary was the beginning of true religious freedom. 412.15 - Like, with independence, the Church of England ceased to be the Church of America. 416.01 - And some founders, like Jefferson, were Deists, believing that God had created the world, but then stepped away to, like, create other universes or try to build a boulder too big for him to lift. 425.85 - Jefferson called for a “wall of separation” between Church and State that’s best embodied in the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia, which Jefferson was so proud of that he had it mentioned on his tombstone. 436.199 - And the American revolution profoundly changed the economy, too. 439.13 - Like, all these new ideas of liberty led to a decline in apprenticeship and indentured servitude. 443.71 - And, immediately after the war, you began to see the split between the North, with its reliance on paid labor, and the South, with its reliance on slavery. 450.53 - Slavery was actually on the decline in the South until Eli Whitney went and invented the cotton gin in 1793, which: 456.039 - A. made it possible to turn a profit growing inferior American cotton, 460.24 - and B. reinvigorated slavery. Yay, innovation. 464.14 - Oh, no. It’s time for the Mystery Document! 468.64 - The rules are simple: Mystery Document. Get it wrong: shock pen. Get it right: WOOO. 473.04 - “An equality of property constantly operating to destroy combinations of powerful families, is the very soul of a republic – 480.52 - While this continues, the people will inevitably possess both power and freedom; 485.43 - when this is lost, power departs, liberty expires, and a commonwealth will inevitably assume some other form. 492.26 - Let the people have property, and they will have power – 495.58 - a power that will for ever be exerted to prevent a restriction of the press, and the abolition of trial by jury, or the abridgment of any other privilege.” 504.24 - Stan, why did you put communism in my Mystery Document? 506.81 - All right, so we’ve got a fan of wealth distribution. 508.68 - But, it isn’t Marx because: a) he’s not American, b) he wasn’t born. 512.289 - There were a bunch of far-left hippies in early America with their hemp-growing and their liberty-espousing. 517.56 - Ugh, I hate the shock pen. 519.52 - All right, I’m gonna guess that it is noted lexicographer, Noah Webster. 523.94 - [Dinging Noise] AH HA YES! 525.96 - Yes, yes, yes! Yes! NAILED IT! Yes. 530.6 - Stan, that was the best one ever. That was my biggest victory to date. 533.78 - So it’s worth remembering that some early Americans proposed a vision of liberty that sprung out of the idea of equality of property, which is very different from the way we imagine liberty today. 542.28 - But ideas of liberty – as diverse as they were – are really at the heart of what makes the American Revolution revolutionary. 547.92 - And that brings us back to slavery. 550.04 - The most common complaint among American high school students is that the Revolution was deeply hypocritical. 555.16 - I mean, how could this guy write that “All men were created equal” when he himself held slaves? 560.44 - And had kids with one of them. 562.0 - And, even crazier, American colonists, often referred to themselves as slaves because they were denied the right to have a vote in parliament about their taxation. 570.44 - Now, some people recognized that it was a smidge hypocritical to claim to be enslaved by British taxation while they themselves were ACTUALLY enslaving people. 579.0 - But very few made the leap to say that liberty should mean freedom for the slaves. 583.14 - One exception was James Otis of Massachusetts who wrote, concerning America’s slaves, that unless they were free, there could be no liberty: 589.24 - “What man is or ever was born free if every man is not?” 593.76 - But most of the Founders, including this guy and this guy, were the cream of the colonial elites, and so they held slaves and made arguments against abolition. 601.7 - Like, many historians now argue that Jefferson was trying to condemn slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but without slavery he wouldn’t have had his amazing life. 609.38 - I mean, if he’d been working, he couldn’t have designed Monticello or stolen all of those ideas from John Locke. 614.36 - And speaking of Locke, Locke equated liberty with property. 617.82 - And a revolution based on securing property against tyranny couldn’t very well turn around and take slaves, who after all were considered property. 625.96 - I mean, Jefferson once calculated that his slaves gave him a better financial return than his real estate investments. 631.22 - That being said, there were many and frequent protests against slavery. 635.24 - The most vociferous protesters were often African Americans, and in the northern states at least, their pleas were heard. 639.92 - Between 1777 and 1804, all states north of Maryland got rid of slavery, although most did so at a very slow pace and were careful not to deprive slave owners of the value of their property. 650.14 - Like, as late as 1830, there were still about 3,500 slaves in the North; 653.54 - and on the eve of the Civil war there were still 18 in New Jersey. NEW JERSEY. 657.82 - So, the number of free people of color in the U.S. skyrocketed. 660.42 - There were fewer than 10,000 in 1776; by 1810, there were nearly 200,000 free black Americans. 666.76 - So, in the end, real change came, as it usually does, not through a revolutionary event but through a revolutionary process. 673.54 - To me, the really novel idea that emerged from the American Revolution was of American equality. 678.04 - Now obviously this was (and remains) a vastly unequal social order, but I’m talking about the kind of equality that Gordon Wood described in his famous book “The Radicalism of the American Revolution”: 687.84 - The idea that no one American is inherently better than any other. 691.74 - Prior to the revolution, and certainly in Europe, there were definitely classes of superior people, usually determined by birth. 697.47 - I mean, people knew their place and they were expected to be deferential to their “betters.” 701.05 - But all that talk of freedom and inalienable rights introduced the idea that birth wasn’t destiny, and that all people should be treated with respect. 708.3 - And the idea that no one should be denied the opportunity to succeed because of who their parents were catalyzed change not just in America but around the world. 715.86 - And while the U.S. no longer leads in equality of opportunity, that early American idea that we are all equal in our capacity to reason and to work became the foundation not just for the American Revolution, but for many others that would come afterward. 729.16 - Thanks for watching.

what's up guys Wale here welcome back to the  channel in today's video i'm gonna be talking   4.08 - about some of the different competencies  and resources that can be helpful for people   8.96 - that have no data analysis experience and are  interested in getting started in learning data   13.84 - analysis recently i was discussing with a friend  who is quite interested in data analysis and i was   18.96 - asking him what tool he planned on learning first  and his answer was python and i asked why python   26.0 - and he says because it's the hottest tool right  now and everyone is talking about it so i know   31.28 - there's a lot of buzz around learning python to  be a data analyst and it's easy to get carried   36.4 - away with that buzz but try not to get carried  away rather you want to see through the noise   41.68 - and find a tool that suits your style and then  you can gradually build competence around that   47.28 - too so i'm going to provide some options to some  resources which are going to be free extremely   52.96 - beginner friendly and i'm going to focus on the  core competencies to get you started generally   58.64 - there are four main areas to build competence  in data analysis and very broadly i list them as   64.8 - data querying that are cleaning analyzing data  using statistical or non-statistical methods   71.04 - and data visualizations so as a data analyst  you'll be required to be knowledgeable using   76.56 - one or a combination of microsoft excel  sql tableau or power bi python or r 89.2 - the reason why microsoft excel is first on  the list is because if you work in a corporate   93.6 - organization or plan to work in a corporate  organization most of the data analysis tasks   99.36 - you will do will be on microsoft excel typically  your colleagues will send you an excel file   104.16 - to work with and it might be unnecessary  and sometimes inconvenient to switch   109.2 - into python to do an analysis that can be  done using excel as a beginner data analyst   114.0 - it is important to learn microsoft excel  and you should really be aiming to become   118.72 - knowledgeable in areas involving the use of  salt and filter vlookups pivot tables formulas   125.68 - and basic data cleaning methods to master excel  for an absolute beginner here are the courses   131.84 - i would recommend introduction to data analysis  using excel you'll find this course on edx it's   138.0 - a free course for four weeks where you learn  how to use pivot tables aggregate functions   144.0 - in basic knowledge of formulas cell referencing  and many more after taking this course then you   150.08 - can jump into the next course which is also an edx  which is analyzing and visualizing data with excel   156.72 - here you'll learn how to import data from  different sources using power query manipulate   162.4 - your data using dax formulas and prepare for data  analysis into power bi one major limitation with   168.64 - excel is it's limited to one million rows of  data so when working with large set of data it   173.6 - starts to become slow and might crash on you a  few times but if your job does not require huge   179.12 - data set then microsoft excel is good enough  nonetheless i cannot deny the huge demand for   184.96 - data analysts with sql and tablet skills so i  get the need for picking those skills up as well 195.68 - sql is a language that lets you as a  data analyst interact with a database   199.84 - a database is a collection of  data stored in a computer system   203.76 - usually large volumes of data where accessing  it requires some form of structured coding   209.12 - as a data analyst you might be required to  run sql queries and to do so you must first   214.72 - understand the basis of relational database  and structure specifically things like primary   220.56 - key foreign key relationships between tables  then you go ahead and learn sql functions like   227.2 - select statement from statement where statement  group by order by joins area you want to master   235.12 - for learning sql again you can check out this edx  course on sql it's called sql for data science   242.08 - alternatively you can check out khan academy's sql  course called intro to sql querying and managing 249.76 - data the third competence to learn is either one  of tab u or power bi i just finished learning   260.16 - tableau and what i discovered was it's not so much  different from power bi you do basically the same   266.72 - thing which is to visualize large data sets and  the cool thing about both 2 is you can import   273.2 - your data directly from sql or a csv file or  any other database to create your visualizations   280.32 - at this point because you're already  familiar with visualizations using excel   285.36 - it becomes super easy to understand how  to use either one of tablet or power bi   290.4 - to learn power bi once again head over to edx  enroll for the analyzing and visualizing data with   297.28 - power bi costs in this course you'll  learn how to identify different types   301.36 - of data visualizations and how to create  fully functional reports and dashboards   310.8 - now finally python as a data analyst python is  used to manipulate data similar to what you do   317.52 - on sql python is also used in data science for  highly mathematical and statistical analysis when   325.28 - using python what you're really learning is how to  use statistics to analyze data remember my friend   331.76 - who's learning how to use python so far he's  gotten a hang of some of the theoretical concepts   337.68 - however there is the practical side which he is  currently struggling with and by practical side   343.04 - i mean how do you know what sort of problems or  challenges that should be solved using statistics   350.16 - not all analysis requires statistics and that's  something you must be aware of as a data analyst   356.0 - so some of the basic statistical concepts  you should be aware of or you should know   360.88 - are sampling frequency distribution mean media  mode measures of variability standard deviation   368.32 - probability significant testing z-scores  confidence intervals and a b testing all these   375.04 - can be learned and practiced using microsoft excel  data analysis 2-pack even before picking up python   381.6 - class so if you ask me learning python is quite  optional which is the whole essence of this video   389.04 - i do not want people to feel they have to learn  python or r to become data analyst trust me i know   395.68 - data analysts that have worked solely on excel  and they are fine even right now as a data analyst   401.28 - most of the work that i do is a microsoft excel  and to really show you this here is a data analyst   406.48 - role on Andela Andela is a renowned technology  slash i.t talent pool company in Africa and   413.2 - let's jump straight to the requirements for this  role here you have must have deep understanding   418.32 - of statistics have strong excel skills have  experience with sql and database management   425.2 - have experience with any statistical analysis  package such as excel spss and sas so the bottom   433.2 - line is you can be a data analyst with the  simple tools at your disposal start with excel   439.68 - move over to sql if you need to try  your hands on different visualizations   444.08 - tab your power bi if you're really curious and  you want to take it a step higher by all means use   449.44 - python at the end of the day as long as you can  use the tool to get the job done then fantastic 459.36 - you must find ways to apply your knowledge in  specific projects to deepen your experience   464.16 - and showcase your skills without projects you will  not be able to retain what you've learned for long   469.92 - cargo.com is one place to download some  data sets and play around with them   474.32 - apply the knowledge you've learned and experiment  with different visualizations it will help   478.96 - increase your confidence levels significantly  all right if you have any questions do leave   483.44 - them down in the comment section below i'd  be happy to answer them and if this video   487.68 - has been helpful to you in any way do smash  the like button so that others can benefit   492.72 - as well thanks for watching and  i'll see you in the next one"}}

No, instead, we're going to look at why we have elections 29.18 - in the first place, and the institutions and procedures that structure the way elections work in America. 33.56 - We might even compare them to elections in other places, but I can't make any promises. 37.02 - [Theme Music] 45.94 - Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how elections work in the U.S., it might be a 49.239 - good time to ask a question that rarely gets asked, \"Why do we have elections in the first place?\" 53.14 - A simple answer is, \"Complexity.\" America's too big and complex to hold public referendums 57.86 - on individual issues, although some states, like California, try to do it. So, instead, we choose 62.0 - representatives. In other words, we vote for people, not policies. Elections are as good a system holding 66.34 - these representatives accountable as any. Well,  at least they're better than violence or public shaming. 70.42 - Political scientists and economists have a more complicated way of describing this in 73.68 - terms of \"adverse selection.\" Because why would we want a simple answer when we have 77.08 - political scientists and economists around? Well, they gotta do somethin'. Adverse selection 80.939 - is a problem that can arise when we make a choice but do not necessarily have all the 84.28 - information we need to make that choice. Kind of like when you buy a used car. 87.44 - Elections help to solve this problem because they are ideally competitive. The competition 91.18 - creates incentives for candidates to provide information about themselves and to make most 94.9 - of that information accurate since their opponent will call them out for any statements that 98.46 - are less than truthful. At least, that's what we hope will happen. 101.46 - Elections also supposedly make candidates more accountable since they provide voters 105.159 - a chance to get rid of bad actors. Of course, this only works when elections are 108.86 - competitive, and, as we'll see in a later episode, many elections in the U.S. really aren't. 112.66 - You might think that since elections are so important to our politics that they would 115.43 - be featured prominently in the Constitution, but yeah, no. The Constitution does set up 119.649 - a few basic guidelines that structure American elections, but most of the important rules 123.35 - that define the way elections are carried out come out of state laws, legal decisions, 127.09 - and local administrative practices. So what does the Constitution say about elections? 130.45 - Not a lot, as it turns out, except when it comes to choosing the president. 134.07 - President just gets everything... President's so important. 137.09 - The Constitution does lay out the qualifications for running for federal office--which we already 140.8 - when over in our episodes on Congress and the President -- and it describes the number 144.12 - of Representatives and Senators. But mostly the Constitution leaves elections up to the 147.79 - states. Article 1, Section 4 says, \"The times, places and manner of holding elections for 152.42 - Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress 157.14 - may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators. \" 162.16 - And the Constitution was later changed to allow for direct election of Senators with 165.26 - the Seventeenth Amendment, so that last clause doesn't matter so much anymore. The Constitution 169.099 - does say more about the way the President is chosen indirectly through the Electoral 172.32 - College, but the framers messed that up so badly that they had to amend the Constitution 175.849 - after the election of 1800. The Twelfth Amendment, which basically means that the President and 179.689 - Vice-President come from the same political party -- although it doesn't actually say that -- fixed 183.54 - the electoral process. So now it's flawless. But it's still indirect and the qualifications 187.95 - for the electors who choose the president are still left up to the states. 190.79 - Some Constitutional amendments also help to structure American elections. The Twenty-Fourth 194.48 - Amendment outlawed poll taxes, which made it easier for poor people to vote, and the 198.06 - Twenty-Sixth Amendment lowered the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. In general, 201.739 - when Congress addresses voting issues, it's to try to expand the pool of voters. 205.18 - Although the Constitution doesn't specify when elections happen, it does give Congress 208.73 - the power to do so, and it requires that the day on which the electors choose the president 212.31 - has to be one single day. This is in Article Two: \"The Congress may determine the time 216.48 - of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall 220.18 - be the same throughout the United States.\" 222.06 - Congressional laws also help structure elections by making them more fair. The Voting Rights 225.93 - Act of 1965 set up a number of systems to increase voter participation by minority groups, 230.69 - especially African Americans. And Congress also set up the Federal Election Commission, 234.69 - which has some say over elections. I'll tell you who should never be allowed to vote: eagles! 241.36 - You're gerrymandered out of here. 243.11 - But generally, following the Constitution, most aspects of elections are under the control 246.879 - of the states. State laws define how candidates are nominated and get on the ballot, and they 250.819 - can influence the operation of political parties. State laws also determine registration requirements 254.939 - for voting and set up the location and hours of polling places, which vary a lot from state to state. 259.42 - Probably most important for federal elections, state decide the boundaries of Congressional 263.16 - election districts, although not the number of representatives each state has, which is 266.9 - determined by the state's population. We'll talk more about election districts in a future episode. 271.22 - That's what gerrymandering has to do with. Remember when I gerrymandered the eagle? 274.3 - Yeah, that's a preview for what's coming. 276.11 - Although this is not always true in every case, as a general rule of thumb, the federal 279.46 - government is more likely to pass laws that expand voting, and states are the government that restrict 283.74 - voting, especially through registration requirements and taking the vote away from people convicted of felonies. 288.5 - One important aspect of American elections that has been set up by state laws 291.81 - is the way that winners have been decided. We like to say that in America, majority rules. 296.06 - But for the most part, this isn't really true, at least as far as elections are concerned. 299.389 - In most states, and in most elections, we follow the Plurality Rule, and this has important 303.02 - consequences for American politics. Let's go the Thought Bubble. 305.8 - Under the Plurality Rule, the candidate with the most votes wins. The number does not have 309.38 - to be a majority, and the more candidates in the race, the less likely anyone will get the majority. 313.86 - Suppose your election has four candidates: A, B, C, and D. Candidate A gets 20% of the 318.919 - vote, Candidate B gets 30%, candidate C gets 25%, and Candidate D also gets 25%. That should 324.74 - add up to 100%. It does? Thank goodness! Okay, so no one has a majority here, so who wins? 329.26 - Candidate B, of course, because she has the most votes, 30%. Now you'll notice something 332.96 - about this election that may be a bit of a paradox: the significant majority of voters 336.43 - in this election, 70% in fact, have chosen Not B. Yet, B is that one that wins. This 340.729 - is why we need to be very careful when we say that majority rules, because in many cases, it doesn't. 345.0 - But in some cases, it does. Some states do have a majority rule in their elections. In 348.96 - these states, if no candidate gets more than 50% plus 1 of the vote, then the top two vote-getters 353.6 - go on to what's called a run-off election. In this second election, you almost always get a majority. 358.1 - In many cases, we also say that American elections are \"Winner take all.\" This is the case in 362.039 - forty-eight out of fifty states when it comes to electoral votes. What this means is that 365.63 - the winner of the election gets 100% of the state's electoral votes, even though it's 369.8 - likely they wouldn't have carried 100% of the votes. It is possible for a state to decide 373.56 - to award its electoral delegates proportionately, based on the percentage of votes that a candidate receives, 378.08 - or even by electoral district, although the latter rule causes some problems, as we'll see in another episode. 382.71 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, the Plurality Rule can result in the majority of people 386.24 - being represented by someone they voted against. This seems like a bad system, so why do we 390.479 - have it? The main reason is efficiency. Under plurality rule, you get a definite winner 394.55 - that you might not have under a majority rule. It also allows for a greater variety of candidates 398.479 - to win, at least potentially. And it has one key result for America's political system: 402.699 - it pretty much ensures that we will only have two viable political parties. 405.789 - The concept that plurality rules create two-party systems is explained by something called Duverger's Law. 410.72 - Here's how it works. Imagine political parties on a continuum from extreme right to extreme left. 415.06 - Most voters will not fall into either extreme, so the masses of party followers will coalesce 419.36 - around the center-right and center-left. In these conditions, there's no incentive to form a third party 423.82 - because it's likely to take votes away from the centrist party, and thus throw the election to the other party. 428.04 - Let's say that you're on the right of the political spectrum. You like the ideas of 431.02 - the center right party, but you think they're a little bit weak, and you'd like to see someone 434.05 - speak up more for your right-most ideas. You could vote for the candidate whose ideology 438.02 - and policies are more to your liking, but they're not likely to win. Remember, most 441.639 - people prefer center-right ideas over extreme-right ideas. That's why they're extreme. So, the 445.99 - candidate you would most like to support isn't going to win, but what's worse for you is 448.86 - that by voting for them, you take away votes from the candidate you partially agree with. 452.26 - Since people know that third-parties almost never win, we're left with only two parties in the U.S. 455.88 - Now, Duverger's Law is important for political scientists, and it explains broadly why we 459.61 - have two parties, but a look at American politics in the second decade of the twentieth century 463.419 - suggests that parties are more extreme than the model would lead us to believe. The polarization 467.289 - of parties is the subject of another episode on the composition of parties and how they 470.87 - reflect political ideologies. But for now, it's still useful to understand how elections 474.729 - themselves work to shape the party system we have in the U.S. This is what we sometimes 478.49 - call a structural or institutional view of politics, and it's the kind of thing political 482.139 - scientists really, really like. We'll look closely at the actual political parties and 486.139 - who votes for which one in other episodes. But I hope we've provided a little bit of 489.66 - insight into how elections work in the U.S. 491.5 - Thanks for watching.
