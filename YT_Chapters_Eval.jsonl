Last year, I have both, 17.397 - OnePlus 11 & OnePlus 12. 20.0 - Oh my God, it's crazy! This was priced at Rs 60-65K. 23.0 - And this one is going to come to Rs 70-75K.

And there's a silver line that goes across from the back. 116.0 - And you can see the edge of the Hasselblad. 118.0 - But I'll tell you what, it's flat now. 120.0 - Earlier it used to be rounded. 122.0 -

Comparatively, if I compare it with the OnePlus 12, it's 146.723 - lighter. 148.0 - The battery capacity has increased from 600mAh. 151.0 - But still, I feel it's light. 153.0 - Let's see because it has a 6000mAh battery. 155.0 - It has a 211.7g battery. 158.0 - I think this was 222g or something like that. 161.0 - It has a 223g battery. 163.0 - It's weight has reduced from 11-12g. 166.0 - Whereas the battery capacity has increased from 10-15%. 169.0 - It has a 6000mAh battery. 172.0 - So that's very nice. 174.0 - In fact, I like the in-hand feel. 176.0 - If I talk about the protection, 178.0 - there's a ceramic shield in China, but if it comes here, 179.931 - it'll come with Gorilla Glass. 181.0 - Whatever it is, it's a flagship so it has to fall. 184.0 - 1, 2 & boom! 187.0 - Ok. 189.0 - One more time. 191.0 - 1, 2 & boom! 193.0 - Ok, nothing. 196.0 - Absolutely nothing. 198.0 - By the way, it has all the ports & buttons. 201.0 - You get everything on top, there's an IR blaster, stereo 203.52 - speakers, 205.0 - and then that alert slider is also there. 207.0 - It's good & very satisfying. 208.0 - Let's start the phone. 211.0 - Let's see from inside. 213.0 - Look at the display. 215.0 - The bezels are very thin & there's no chin. 218.0 - I'll say it's not there literally. 220.0 - According to me, the screen-to-body ratio would be above 222.754 - 94%. 224.0 - And that's why it looks manageable. 227.0 - Despite having a 6.82'' display, there are no bezels. 231.0 - This is kind of an all display. 233.0 - It's a 6.82'' 2K resolution display. 235.0 - It's a fast resolution display & it's an LTPO display. 238.0 - There's an adaptive refresh rate of 1-120Hz. 241.0 - It has a brightness of 4500 nits as compared to last time. 244.0 - You can adjust it from here, which is around 800 nits. 249.0 -

setting. 298.0 - Battery Life 301.0 - If you're a moderate user & with this kind of battery & 304.384 - charging, 306.0 - you can easily use it for 1.5-2 days. 309.0 - No matter how heavy you use it, it'll last for a day. 312.0 - You can play games all day & the battery will remain. 317.0 - OS 319.0 - It's a Chinese variant & it's on ColorOS. 324.0 - In India, it'll come with OxygenOS skin. 328.0 - It's a Chinese variant & it still needs a lot of 331.147 - permissions. 333.0 - It'll come on Android 15. 335.0 - We'll talk about AI & OS features when it launches in India. 338.0 - Sensors 341.0 - It used to have an optical sensor, but now it has an 343.506 - ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. 346.0 - It's a good thing that the X200 Pro has an ultrasonic 350.356 - fingerprint sensor. 353.0 - So now we're getting flagships with more ultrasonic sensors. 356.0 - Connectivity 358.0 - It has the latest connectivity. 360.0 - It supports 5G, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC & IR Blaster. 365.0 - So it has all connectivity options & sensors. 369.0 - But that's not what's important. 371.0 - Let's talk about the cameras. 373.0 - When we talk about the OnePlus flagship series cameras, 379.0 - we always say that they should've been improved. 384.0 - In the OnePlus 13, it's a Chinese variant. 388.0 - I won't tell you the complete conclusion. 390.0 - But yes, it has 50MP cameras, 3x periscope, 50MP ultrawide, 395.619 - 50MP primary sensor, OS. 399.0 - Yes, it takes good photos. 401.0 - And it has Hasselblad branding & Hasselblad modes. 407.0 - All that is there. 409.0 - But if you compare it with camera centric phones like X200 411.513 - or iPhone, 413.0 - you'll feel that it could've been better. 415.0 - We've taken a lot of photos. 418.0 - I'm giving you the G-Drive link. 420.0 - Do check it out. 422.0 - But let us wait till it arrives on Indian shores. 425.0 - Then we'll review the camera. 428.0 - Selfies 430.0 - It has a 32MP selfie camera. 432.0 - You can shoot 4K 60FPS with all sensors. 436.0 - I'm talking about rear & front. 438.0 - And you can shoot 8K 30FPS in rear as well. 442.0 - So in terms of videography, it has top line specs. 446.0 - In terms of durability, there's an upgrade. 449.0 - It was IP65 in OnePlus 12, now it's IP68 & IP69. 453.0 - So that's a thumbs up. 455.0 - I'll tell you what, it's price is going to increase as well. 457.0 - It's going to increase from Rs 5-10K. 459.0 - And I haven't told you about the variants. 462.0 - It's base variant is going to be 12-256GB. 464.0 - It'll go all the way up to 24GB RAM & 1TB option. 467.0 - Talking about the 12-256GB base variant, 470.0 - I don't think it's going to come below Rs 70K. 472.0 - It'll go up to Rs 70-75K. 474.0 - And in that price range, you have some really good phones 477.75 - including iPhones. 480.0 - And that too flagship level. 482.0 - So the competition is obviously going to increase. 484.0 - Like it used to be that OnePlus flagship is available for 486.63 - Rs 30K. 488.0 - Now it's going to be available for Rs 75K. 490.0 - And for that kind of competition, 493.0 - they should increase the OS upgrades. 495.0 - I mean, 4G & 5G are not enough anymore. 498.0 - They should give at least 6-7 years of upgrades if they 501.013 - demand the price. 503.0 - And definitely when it comes to India, 505.0 - I want to see an improvement in the camera. 507.0 - I think that is the tilting point where I'll say that 510.0 - if OnePlus's camera seriously gives competition 514.0 - with X200, X-Series, Vivo, iPhones or Samsung phones. 518.0 - This is definitely a worthy competition in that particular 520.45 - price range. 522.0 - But I'll tell you what, OnePlus has a lot of fans. 525.0 - They're going to buy this phone, that's for sure. 528.0 - But let's wait till the launch. 531.0 - It'll definitely wait for that video, it's going to be very 532.638 - interesting. 534.0 - That's all for this OnePlus 13's Unboxing & First 536.161 - Impressions video. 538.0 - Until then Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: OnePlus 13 Unboxing   1:14 - Pricing and Release Expectations   2:05 -

It's more rugged. 70.32 - It can shoot everything all the time. 73.17 - And that got me thinking, 75.66 - well, it's been almost 10 years 77.31 - since I got into these action cameras. 79.59 - How good are the best ones now? 81.84 - Like, you might remember when we strapped one onto Mac 83.61 - that one day and got the perspective of being a dog in 4K. 87.81 - That was 2014. 89.04 - So similar to that, this one also isn't a review, 91.29 - but this one is sponsored by DJI, 93.6 - and they've got their newest, latest 96.12 - and greatest highest end action camera into my hands. 98.22 - So this is the Action 5 Pro. 100.38 - And I figured I'd use this to take a deeper look at 104.28 - the tech that's gonna hopefully enable more of this, 106.5 - more freestyle shooting that I do in 2025. 109.56 - So the first obvious advantage of the action camera 111.54 - is just how tough it's built, 112.65 - because yes, we know smartphones can do an incredible job 115.44 - with video too, but I don't know about you, 117.9 - I'm just not trying to risk my phone 119.46 - in all these precarious scenarios 121.65 - where it would be cool to get an angle, 123.12 - or you put the camera someplace where it could fall 125.22 - or get smacked around or take a beating, 126.87 - because that's my phone. 128.94 - So, this has always been true since the beginning. 130.95 - I mean, this thing is airtight. It's built like a tank. 133.89 - It's waterproof to 20 meters with no case needed, 137.46 - much better than most smartphones. 139.23 - And then it's also super temperature resistant, 141.6 - so it can operate anywhere from 143.7 - negative 20 Celsius to 45 Celsius. 147.51 - I'll also put the Fahrenheit on the screen for y'all. 149.07 - But no freezing or overheating in any of these temperatures, 151.92 - which is kind of nuts. 152.94 - So being more durable and smaller than any smartphone 155.73 - is a pretty obvious advantage to the action camera 157.98 - in a lot of situations, but the other thing about 160.05 - these things is they've gotten a lot of 161.91 - usability upgrades over the years. 163.8 - So I remember back in the day, 165.57 - these used to just be back screens, 168.36 - which was kind of like point and shoot 170.16 - and cross your fingers if you were on the other side. 172.35 - But now, now they've all got these dual screens, 176.13 - so you've got a screen on the front and on the back, 178.29 - which is really convenient 179.91 - for framing things up in either direction. 182.37 - And this one also happens to have 184.23 - these high brightness OLED screens, 186.18 - so even if it's outside or something, super bright, 188.64 - I can use both screens. 190.17 - And since it's a touchscreen and it's actually usable, 192.93 - I can flip through settings and adjust things 195.6 - and get my framing right on either side. 198.45 - It's actually very useful. 199.53 - So this actually levels up in one other way. 201.0 - It has a feature that I think should be more common 203.55 - than it is, which is internal storage. 207.21 - So this camera has 47 gigs of internal storage. 211.56 - Hold on, Zuri. 213.0 - Which means it's saved me a couple times already 214.59 - where I forget to go get a memory card, 216.84 - but I still have enough storage built in to record. 219.81 - Petition for all cameras to have that. 221.61 - I think they should all do it. 222.6 - They should all have internal recording 223.92 - so they can just record whenever, 225.09 - and if I have a card, then I can record more. 227.16 - So this will do... 228.66 - This is 47 gigs, it's two hours. I'm good for a while. 233.04 - All right, run free, go explore. 235.98 - Battery life is very solid, 237.33 - up to four hours nonstop recording 238.95 - if you turn the screen off. 240.36 - And then DGI has a similar clever charger 243.03 - that they have with their drones, 244.53 - basically, where if you put all of the batteries 246.27 - in this case and then charge the case, 248.94 - it just tops each of them up, 250.2 - and the camera itself actually will quick charge 253.05 - if you just plug it right in with USB-C. 254.55 - I don't have a wattage, but I plugged it in at zero 257.25 - and it got to 20% in four minutes, 259.35 - and then it was full in 40. 260.76 - There's also a pressure sensor, 262.14 - so you can tell at any time how deep underwater you are 264.96 - or how high of an altitude you're at, 267.18 - if that's what you're interested in shooting. 268.5 - And also then there's just a bunch of accessories for it 271.29 - for building out and shooting whatever angle, 274.32 - whatever subject you want. 275.91 - So, maybe something kind of weird like this. 279.57 - Give me a second. 280.81 - (balls clattering) 285.803 - (ball snaps) 287.79 - I would normally not at all be comfortable 289.92 - putting my phone out in front of me, 292.62 - hitting golf balls like this, but it's kind of a cool angle. 297.088 - (balls snapping) 302.85 - Oh, that was close. 304.17 - Probably one of the best things about this camera 305.49 - is that it attaches to any accessory you want 307.5 - via this magnetic quick release system at the bottom, 310.56 - which has been pretty standardized 311.79 - with this thing for the past few years. 313.83 - I think other companies are starting to follow along, too. 316.11 - Matter of fact, the benefits of this one specifically, 318.18 - since it's made by DJI, 320.07 - it's directly compatible with other things DJI also makes, 324.12 - like their newest mics, the Mic 2, 325.725 - so you can pair that easily straight to the action cam 329.46 - and get scratch audio from the built in microphones. 332.4 - On top of all of that, it actually 333.63 - plug and plays as a webcam. 335.55 - So when you plug it in, the options come up, 338.07 - select Webcam, and it actually levels up 341.4 - a lot of people's webcam experiences, which is pretty sick. 345.06 - Just remember to brush the dust off of it 347.19 - before you actually do. 348.36 - But it's gotta look good. 349.193 - Like, the whole point of this 350.58 - is that you have this camera everywhere with you, 352.92 - but that the footage actually looks good. 355.05 - So none of this matters if the footage doesn't look good. 358.02 - So this action cam in 2024 has one of the best. 361.301 - It has a one over 1.3 inch sensor that can shoot up to 4K 364.59 - at 120 FPS slow-mo if you want to. 367.59 - There are a couple other high-end smartphones out right now 369.54 - with roughly the same size sensor. 371.04 - I actually think one over 1.3 inches 372.57 - is the same as the Galaxy S23 Ultra, 375.12 - so that's a good example. 376.68 - So, big enough to gather plenty of light. 378.57 - It's an F/2.8 lens. 380.13 - And then on top of that, since it's a dedicated camera, 382.74 - yes, it can shoot LOG. 384.39 - It's got a 10 bit D-Log M, it's got HLG, 387.9 - so that you can get even more dynamic range 389.85 - to mess with in editing after the fact. 392.61 - Of course, you can always just shoot normal mode 394.08 - if you want, but if you ever want that extra range, 395.94 - it's just a quick flip away on the touchscreen settings. 398.22 - And it has one of the widest fields of view. 400.35 - This is the thing about action cameras, 401.7 - is they get super wide, but this one is 155 degrees, 405.69 - so it gives you a ton of room to work with 407.22 - if you wanna shoot in the most ultra wide mode. 409.2 - But there's also less distortion in the more cropped modes 413.34 - depending on what you're shooting. 414.78 - It's actually plenty wide enough to shoot first person stuff 417.27 - like driving, for example, in normal mode, 420.63 - or driving, for example. 423.552 - (ball snaps) 424.385 - No distortion needed. 425.218 - So that brings me to my last point, 427.02 - which is just bang for the buck. 428.85 - Like, a tiny camera like this that you can take everywhere 431.4 - is gonna be cheaper than a smartphone 433.29 - that you put at risk all the time 434.67 - that you actually use for your phone. 436.14 - So, this camera starts at 349 bucks. 440.49 - And also let's not forget 441.323 - the internal storage that it comes with. 442.77 - So you can pick one of these up and however many accessories 444.99 - and mounts and things you want, and run around outside 447.48 - and beat it up and put it at risk all the time, 449.88 - and then at the end of the day, if it's still fine, 453.226 - So I think the main thing that I've taken away from 454.876 - all the fun that I've had with these little cameras is, 457.666 - you know, there's that famous quote, I dunno who said it, 459.556 - but, \"The best camera is the one you have with you.\" 461.413 - You always hear that quoted everywhere. 463.636 - And I think I've been leaning into that more 466.966 - because of how often I don't have my camera with me, 471.526 - like, the cinema camera, the super high end, the Red camera. 475.216 - There are a ton of instances that I can recall 478.486 - of, like, say I'm doing a tech review 480.226 - and there's something really cool that happens on a device, 482.836 - or maybe like a shooting scenario with a smartphone camera, 485.596 - and I can kind of just tell you 487.606 - after the fact about what happened, 489.286 - instead of actually having the camera 490.846 - to point at it and show you. 493.096 - I wanna just have the camera with me more often 495.766 - and just be able to show you the thing. 497.056 - So what I'm definitely not saying is that I'm, like, 498.886 - done with, you know, the super high end, fun cameras. 501.676 - I still love them. 502.636 - There's a reason why we shoot so much stuff 504.736 - with the Reds and in the studio, 506.656 - and that will always have its place. 507.946 - But what my goal is going forward, 510.706 - especially, is to have the camera with me more often. 514.906 - Obviously I'll have my smartphone in my pocket, 516.466 - but just having a camera all the time, everywhere, 519.436 - whether it's in my pocket or in my bag or whatever, 522.226 - so that when that shooting scenario comes up, 524.926 - I can capture it, and that can actually go in the video. 527.446 - That's what I'm trying to do. 528.766 - Hopefully you're with me on that 530.566 - and hopefully you're down to see 532.306 - those videos when they come out. 533.386 - Also, if you wanna see that video, 534.526 - that'll be on the Auto Focus channel pretty soon. 537.196 - It's a pretty crazy one. 538.606 - Anyway, let me know what you think in the comments. 540.406 - Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. 543.366 - Peace. 544.324 - (upbeat music)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timestamps: 0:00 -

249.319 - It comes with Dimensity 7020 processor with 8GB RAM, 256GB 255.735 - RAM, LPDDR4X RAM type, 259.319 - UFS 2.2 storage type, 5000mAh battery, 33W charging. 263.319 - But the best part is that it has wireless charging. 266.319 - You get 15W wireless charging. 270.319 - Let's test it. 273.319 - It's a Rs 17-18K phone & it has wireless charging. 276.319 - I really want to see if it works properly. 279.319 - Let's do it in front of you. 281.319 - It's started to charge. 283.319 - Let's see with the cover as it has MagSafe. 286.319 - Oh, look at that! 288.319 - So wireless charging works. 290.319 - And if you want wireless charging under Rs 20K, I don't 293.24 - think there's any other phone other than Infinix Note 40. 297.319 - And it's not even a Pro, it's a normal 40. We've seen the 299.569 - 40 Pro & Pro Plus. 301.319 - But you get wireless charging even in the normal non-Pro model. 305.319 - So that's good in terms of specifications. 307.319 - If I talk about the OS, you get XOS which is based on Android 14. 311.319 - And there are 2-3 years security updates. 314.319 - Especially the bloatware that was prevalent 1-1.5 years ago 318.151 - has been removed. 320.319 - You can even uninstall 3rd party apps. 324.319 - You really get a very clean experience. 327.319 - And we had said this when we did the Infinix unboxing, that 329.505 - remove the bloatware. 331.319 - But it's not there anymore. 333.319 - If I talk about the features, it's about the halo lighting. 335.319 - When you're charging or listening to music, you'll see it 336.948 - at the back. 338.319 - There are 2-3 more things that I found interesting. 340.319 - There's an AI wallpaper generator. 342.319 - Yes, it's not the best out there. 344.319 - But you'll be able to generate AI with a prompt. 346.319 - There's a 6-day limit, but that's there. 348.319 - And there's blank data. 350.319 - If there's a medical app that's asking for your personal information, 355.319 - you can set it so that it'll only send blank data. 359.319 - Just to ensure that the app is running. So that's good. 361.319 - And there's a repair mode. 363.319 - If you put it in repair mode, no one will be able to access your data. 366.319 - So there are some good features in the XOS. 368.319 - So that is good. 370.319 - And before moving ahead, I'd like to say that it's a clean UI. 372.319 - So the size of the OS has also been reduced. 375.319 - It hardly takes 18-19GB. 377.319 - If it takes under 20GB, you get nearly 230-228GB out of 256GB. 382.319 - Which is very very good. 384.319 - If I talk about connectivity, there's dual band WiFi, 386.319 - Bluetooth 5.2 support, 14 5G bands. 389.319 - Basically all the bands are supported. 392.319 - No problems, there's dual 4G VoLTE WiFi calling support. 394.319 - And yes, you also have NFC & IR blaster. 396.319 - This phone is also very good for multimedia. 399.319 - Firstly, the display is immersive, bright, colors are good, 401.68 - AMOLED display. 403.319 - So video viewing experience is good. 405.319 - JBL tuned stereo speakers are available. 407.319 - Because of which the audio quality, loudness & volume is also good. 410.319 - So it's also great for multimedia. 412.319 - Absolutely no problems. 414.319 - Widevine L1 is certified, so you can do HD streaming. 416.319 - If you want to watch Netflix prime videos, you can easily 417.86 - do HD streaming. 419.319 - There's no HDR support, but yes, Widevine L1 is available. 422.319 - And if I talk about other features, there's SAR value within limits. 425.319 - Let me tell you about the notification light. 427.319 - You get quad LED lights at the back & dual LEDs at the front. 431.319 - I'll tell you about the camera, but yes, 433.319 - the dual LEDs are useful when you're taking selfies. 435.319 - Then you have FM radio, notification light, 438.319 - the halo lighting at the back, 441.319 - so technically it's there. 443.319 - And yes, there's IP53 certification. 445.319 - Let's talk about the cameras. 447.319 - I thought there were dual cameras, but there are triple cameras. 449.319 - But the primary sensor is the main 108MP primary sensor. 453.319 - The other 2MP sensors are depth sensors. 455.319 - I'm not going to talk about that. 457.319 - There's a 32MP selfie sensor. 459.319 - And you can shoot 2K videos. 461.319 - We've taken photos & samples. 463.319 - If you want to see the original quality, I'm giving you the G-Drive link. 465.319 - Go & check it out. 467.319 - In normal conditions, the photos are good. 470.319 - Generally, Infinix phones are not known for the camera. 472.319 - But yes, they are improving. 474.319 - You go & see the photos & let us know your thoughts in the comments. 477.319 - If I talk about the camera app, 479.319 - you get all the features you expect. 481.319 - Let me tell you, because it's 108MP, you get 3x lossless zoom 487.319 - So you won't lose much quality by zooming in 3x. 491.319 - And if I talk about the features, 493.319 - there's film, portrait, AI cam, all the features are there. 496.319 - And as mentioned in the video, you can shoot 2K 30FPS in 498.59 - the front & back. 500.319 - But overall, if you look at the Infinix Note 40 5G, 505.319 - the standout feature is wireless charging, 508.319 - which is unheard of in the price range under Rs 20K. 509.319 - And another thing about the charging, 512.32 - you get by-pass charging support. 514.32 - If you're playing games, you don't have to use the battery. 517.32 - So that's there. 519.32 - And you can also do reverse wireless charging. 521.32 - You can charge the buds with the phone. 523.32 - And if I talk about the gaming performance, 526.32 - you can play games on medium settings. 529.32 - The display & speakers are good, so you're going to enjoy it. 532.32 - You can play 40FPS BGMI games without any problems. 535.32 - There's also smart charging support. 536.32 - In fact, it has a power management chipset called Cheetah X1 541.32 - So it's good for fast & wireless charging. 545.32 - If I talk about the sensors, 547.32 - all the sensors are there & they're generally side-mounted. 550.32 - Again, in the Rs 15-18K price range, 552.32 - it's not always side-mounted. 554.32 - It has an in-display fingerprint sensor & face unlock works well. 556.32 - So what do you think about the Infinix Note 40 5G? 558.32 - If I talk about the display, 560.32 - you get decent performance & a decent camera for multimedia. 563.32 - Overall, for the Rs 17-18K price range, you're getting a lot! 568.32 - Before ending the video, 570.32 - this video is a collaboration with Infinix. 573.32 - But we've tested it & we've shared the results with you. 577.32 - If you're interested, you can buy it right now. 579.32 - There are offers on Flipkart for a no cost EMI of Rs 1,333. 584.32 - So go ahead & check it out! 586.32 - This is the Infinix Note 40 5G. 589.32 - If you enjoyed the video, then do hit LIKE! 590.32 - If you have any questions, do ask them in the COMMENTS section. 594.32 - That's all for this video. 595.169 - Until then Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to the Infinix Note 40 5G 0:28 - Unique Features and Pricing Highlights 1:18 - Unboxing and Accessories Overview 2:32 - Design and Build Quality 3:45 - Display and Specifications 5:00 - Software, Features, and Clean UI 6:18 - Camera Features and Performance 7:45 - Gaming, Performance, and Charging Capabilities 8:52 - Final Thoughts and Offers"}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.55 - What is a server? So that is a topic of this  video. Now a server is basically a dedicated   7.57 - computer that provides services on behalf of  clients, such as ordinary desktop computers   13.93 - or workstations. So it's a centralized machine  where multiple clients connect to, either over   20.14 - the Internet or in a local area network, and they  connect to a server for a specific service.  So   26.5 - for example, that service could be to retrieve a  website, to access data, or email, and so on. Now   33.43 - a server could be dedicated to handle one of these  services only, where you would have one server   39.22 - it dedicated for a website, one server for data  storage, and a server for email. And this model is   45.79 - what larger organizations use. Or you can also set  up a server to handle each of these services on   52.09 - the same machine which is what typically happens  in smaller organizations. So depending upon which   58.45 - setup is used it all depends on the needs of an  organization. Now when people talk about a server   65.59 - generally they are referring to a powerful  centralized computer that clients connect to   71.44 - over a network, and they would be correct on that.  However a server is not just a physical computer.   78.04 - A server is actually a role that a computer takes.  Because any ordinary desktop computer can be set   85.93 - up as a server and it doesn't necessarily have to  be a powerful computer. So for example you can set   92.23 - up a network in your home where you can have an  ordinary desktop computer serve as a file server.   98.53 - The computer would have those files in a shared  folder and then other computers can connect to   104.62 - it to access those files.  Or you can also use  a desktop computer to serve as a web server,   111.19 - where you would install the website data on that  computer and then the other computers can connect   117.04 - to it and retrieve the webpage.  However desktop  computers do have their limitations because they   124.18 - are not designed to handle a large workload and  they can't handle a lot of incoming connections   130.3 - from users.  And this is not only because of their  inferior hardware, but it's also because of software.   136.45 - Because desktop operating systems are only able to  handle a limited amount of concurrent connections.   142.51 - Now servers need to be up and running 24/7 because  they are vital to an organization.  And if a server   151.69 - does go down then that could jeopardize a business  or an organization.  So this is why servers need to   158.92 - be more reliable.  They need to be built with robust  hardware that's able to run non-stop with little   165.76 - to no downtime.  So for example, a desktop would  use a processor that's designed obviously for   173.38 - desktops, such as the Intel core series processors.  And a server would use a processor designed for   180.58 - servers such as the Intel Xeon processor.  A server  processor needs to be fast and had the ability to   187.51 - perform a lot of tasks simultaneously.  Now both  of these processors are powerful but there are   194.68 - some differences.  So for example, Xeon processors  support a multi processing environment.  So they   201.73 - are designed to work with other processors.  Which  means you can put two or more Xeon processors on   208.39 - a motherboard designed for servers, which is what  a lot of servers need to handle a large workload.   214.87 - But desktop processors do not support this, they  are only designed to work by themselves and not   221.62 - with other processors.  And another difference  is that Xeon processors support ECC RAM, which   229.51 - is error code correcting memory.  And this type  of memory is what's mainly used in servers.  Now   235.39 - servers need to be up and running at all times  and memory errors could bring down a server and   241.33 - what ECC does is that it detects if the data was  correctly processed by the RAM module and it makes   248.14 - a correction if it needs to to prevent memory  errors.  So using ECC memory in servers is just   255.31 - an extra precaution to guard against any errors to  prevent a server from shutting down and Intel Core   262.33 - processors do not support ECC Ram, however AMD  processors do so support it.  Xeon processors can also   271.21 - support a larger amount of RAM.  They would have  a larger cache memory.  And they would also have   277.12 - a higher core count than desktop processors.  And a  server should also have hot swappable hard drives   284.92 - in a RAID configuration because if a hard drive  were to fail then no data loss what happened and   291.1 - the server would still be up and running because  of RAID.  RAID is what copies that data on multiple   297.04 - disks and if a hard drive were to fail then it  can be removed and replaced without shutting   303.1 - down the server.  And then RAID would rebuild  the data on the new hard drive automatically. 310.68 - And a server should also have redundant power supplies to   314.91 - keep the server up and running  in case of a power supply failure. 321.98 - And a server also needs to use a server operating  system, such as Linux, Windows Server, mac OS server   330.62 - and so on.   Server operating systems are robust and  stable and they are designed to run non-stop and   338.15 - are able to handle thousands of concurrent  connections.  Now there are many different   344.21 - types of servers and when I mean types I'm  talking about the type of service that the   349.79 - server provides.  So for example, a web server.    A web server is what hosts a website.  So any   356.87 - website that you go to with your web browser,  you are connecting over the Internet to that   362.15 - web server to pull up the web site you want.  The  web server will contain all of the website's   367.64 - data, including the HTML code and graphics and  it will also be running the web server software.   373.85 - another type of server is an email server an  email server is what facilitates the sending   380.63 - And receiving of email and you would access the  email using your web browser or you can use an   386.66 - email client such as Outlook or Thunderbird  using email protocols such as IMAP,, POP, and   393.65 - SMTP.  And a database server is another type  of server.  This type of server stores data   400.22 - on the backend and then it's retrieved from  computers on the front end, for example using   405.98 - queries such as SQL.  So these are just a few  examples of what servers do but there is a lot   413.51 - more.  So thank you everyone for watching this  video on servers and the difference between   418.97 - servers and desktop computers.  Please subscribe,  follow me on Twitter, and thank you for watching."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: What is a Server? 0:26 - Understanding Server Services 0:52 - Dedicated vs. Multi-Service Servers 1:18 - Servers vs. Desktop Computers 2:42 - Reliability and Hardware of Servers 3:55 - ECC RAM and RAID for Data Integrity 4:45 - Importance of Server Operating Systems 5:22 - Common Types of Servers 6:14 - Web, Email, and Database Servers Explained 6:50 - Conclusion and Final Thoughts"}]}

from the day i started messing around with  some data in Excel it took me about three   4.24 - years to land a data analyst job at Heineken and  another two years to land a job as a freelance   9.2 - data analyst at a big bank in Europe and another  two years to quit that job and travel the world   13.84 - full-time but more on that later can you become  a data analyst way faster? 100% i've wasted too   19.6 - many hours watching youtube tutorials and i've  spent money on Udemy courses that didn't add   24.8 - any value so i often ask myself if i could start  over with data analysis knowing what i know today   30.8 - how would i go about it? and that's exactly what  this video is about i'll remove all the fluff and   36.0 - give you the fastest path to go from zero to  a full-time data analyst and throughout this   41.52 - video i will share the three major mistakes almost  every data analyst makes so stay tuned for those   47.28 - the first thing every beginner data analyst needs  to pick is a tool or programming language for data   52.88 - analysis i personally started off with Excel is  that the best tool there is for data analysis no   58.56 - if i could go back in time would have started  with something else also no because apparently   63.92 - getting good at Excel was enough for my first  data analysis job and i personally recommend   68.72 - every single data analyst to start off with  Excel it's easy to learn used in almost every   73.44 - company and it has a wide range of applications  for data analysis but this is also it's pitfall   79.52 - although you can do a lot of different things  in Excel it's not designed specifically for   84.32 - data analysis meaning it has its limitations  you want to work with a very large data set   89.28 - well good luck not punching through your computer  screen after Excel crashes for the 27th time   96.48 - Excel is perfect for starting out but once  you've mastered excel it's time to move on   101.36 - to the more serious tools and the most logical  tool to learn next is SQL next to Excel it is   107.2 - apparently the second most requested skill in data  analyst job openings huge thanks to Luke Barousse   113.6 - for actually scraping a lot of Linkedin  job openings to come up with these facts   117.84 - you're a legend man thank you what up that nerds  and the reason SQL is so in demand is because   122.4 - it doesn't have the same limitations as Excel  why is my accent suddenly changing to southern   130.48 - i don't know what with SQL you can extract  transform and load very large data sets but   135.52 - the best thing about it is that SQL has its own  very easy to use programming language it's a great   140.88 - tool to add to your skill set as a data analyst  while also being a great stepping stone to some   145.44 - more serious programming but before we get to  that every data analyst needs a visualization   150.4 - tool there are dozens of BI tools out there but  having worked for multiple companies and projects   156.72 - and having looked at probably hundreds of data  analyst job openings i've come to realize that   161.36 - the majority of companies are looking for people  with experience with Tableau Power BI and Qlikview   167.76 - here's the pros and cons of each so you can decide  which suits you best Power BI is part of the   172.56 - Microsoft stack so it works smoothly with Excel  and Sharepoint besides that it has a free version   178.32 - and even the paid versions are relatively budget  friendly compared to the other BI tools next up is   184.0 - Tableau Tableau is a BI tool with more extensive  data visualization capabilities than Power BI   190.08 - it seems to be just a bit more in demand in  the job market than Power BI it comes with   195.12 - a much higher price tag though making it harder  to learn if you're starting out by yourself and   199.68 - then there's Qlikview using in-memory technology  making it a super fast and responsive way of doing   206.32 - business intelligence but also a pretty high price  tag and also it's less in demand than Tableau and   212.56 - Power BI i personally picked Power BI as my BI  tool although it might not be the fastest BI tool   217.92 - out there or the one with the most extensive  capabilities in my opinion it can give you   222.24 - the most bang for buck when it comes to becoming a  full-time data analyst before we move on to how to   227.84 - actually get good at data analysis and land that  first job there's one more thing we need to do   232.72 - as a data analyst after you've mastered a BI tool  it's time to get into the more advanced analytics   238.48 - i'm talking about which programming language  to use when it comes to data analysis or data   243.6 - science software developers and programmers get to  choose between java javascript ruby c-sharp python   250.88 - r c c++ and many more luckily for us data analysts  we only have to choose between two programming   257.68 - languages r and python so which one should you  pick i chose python but if i could go back in   264.08 - time i would choose python why well even though  they're actually very similar r is a programming   270.08 - language focused more on statistical analysis  well python is a more general purpose programming   276.16 - language that also happens to be very good for  data analysis and although r might be a little   281.52 - bit easier to learn i would still go for python as  it's the probably probably probably the number one   288.48 - programming language in the world meaning if you  get good at python for data analysis it might also   293.68 - open the door to a lot of different job  opportunities so the path i took is Excel   300.4 - SQL Power BI and Python this is the path i would  recommend as it worked out great for me but you   306.64 - can start off with any language or tool that  suits you best because whatever you pick your   311.92 - first language or tool will definitely not be your  last so now that you know which tools to learn   317.52 - let's talk about how to actually learn it and  this is where beginners make the first major   322.0 - mistake the mistake most beginners make is that  they try to learn by watching others this is how   327.44 - most people learn data analysis some people go to  Udemy and watch multiple 20 plus hour courses and   333.84 - probably not even finish all of them or they watch  youtube videos watching other people analyze data   339.04 - but without actually writing code or analyzing  data themselves they give themselves a false   344.16 - sense of progress because analyzing data in your  head is very different than from actually doing it 353.6 - data analysis in your head is very different  from actually analyzing data stumbling upon   359.92 - faulty data and debugging for hours so what is  the right way to do it? the answer is very simple:   365.36 - learn by doing you just need to get the  reps in and start coding and analyzing   369.92 - data by yourself for Excel i would recommend  a website called www.excel-practice-online.com   375.76 - a free website where you learn to use Excel  by doing from the basics to the most advanced   380.96 - functionalities for SQL i would recommend the  website www.w3schools.com/sql for Power BI i   387.6 - would recommend Datacamp there's free courses  and also paid ones for python you can go to   392.48 - this free website called learnpython.org whether  you're practicing every day at your current job   398.64 - so you can make that switch to a data analysis  career or whether you're still studying you need   403.44 - to practice every single day only this way will  you experience what it's actually like working as   409.04 - a data analyst analysis working as a data analyst  only then will you learn what it's like to debug   415.12 - your own code or formulas because to be honest  that's what you will spend the most time on   420.24 - debugging faulty code or correcting faulty data  being a data analyst is awesome but this is also   427.68 - the second major mistake most beginners make they  try to solve every problem themselves the fact is   434.0 - that error you just got in Power BI there's a very  big chance someone already has experienced exactly   439.68 - the same error as you and that's good news for you  because now you don't have to look for the cause   444.16 - of the error you just have to copy part of the  error message in google and you probably end up on   449.2 - some stack overflow website where someone explains  exactly how to solve this error let's be honest   454.96 - copying code from stack overflow is like 80%  of any developer programmer or data analyst job   462.08 - data analyst is awesome okay now that you know  what tool and programming language to pick   466.8 - and how to actually learn it it's time to build  your portfolio and this will help you build   471.6 - out an attractive CV for recruiters on Linkedin  recruiters i always talk like a bit this i know   477.6 - programmer so strange programming language  and recruiters talk to me every day now if   482.96 - you have a job where you can apply data analytics  already then do so right away if you don't really   487.92 - do anything data analytics related like sales for  example then try to build a report or a dashboard   494.56 - showing some key metrics or KPI's that you  can show to your manager he will appreciate   499.28 - it and you will get to learn your data analysis  skills and if you can't apply to your current job   503.92 - or if you're still studying then start a project  on your own at home because in the end it's about   509.6 - getting that data analyst job and the best way  to do that is as follows pimp up your Linkedin   515.2 - profile i've made a video before where i give  my top five Linkedin profile tips to attract   520.0 - recruiters on Linkedin and i'll summarize it here  for you make sure you put data analysts in as many   525.68 - places as you can in your profile Linkedin is a  search engine and if recruiters search for data   530.4 - analysts you want to be found you want to be on  top of that list so make sure your header contains   534.72 - the word data analyst in your work experience  if you've done something data analyst related   538.64 - put in the keyword data analyst once your Linkedin  profile is set up there's two things you can do   543.44 -

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.0 - Transcriber: Gustavo Rocha Reviewer: Marssi Draw 9.003 - Hi everyone. 11.825 - Two year ago, my life changed forever. 16.625 - My wife Kelsey and I 19.261 - welcomed our daughter Lela into the world. 23.033 - Now, becoming a parent is an amazing experience. 27.456 - Your whole world changes over night. 30.704 - And all of your priorities change immediately. 33.285 - So fast that it makes it really difficult to process sometimes. 39.294 - Now, you also have to learn a tremendous amount about being a parent 43.547 - like, for example, how to dress your child. 46.82 - (Laughter) 47.954 - This was new to me. 50.091 - This is an actual outfit,  I thought this was a good idea. 53.844 - And even Lela knows that it's not a good idea. (Laughter) 59.558 - So there is so much to learn and so much craziness all at once. 64.409 - And to add to the craziness,  Kelsey and I both work from home, 68.533 - we're entrepreneurs, we run our own businesses. 71.223 - So, Kelsey develops courses online for yoga teachers. 76.992 - I'm an author. 78.333 - And so, I'm working from home, Kelsey's working from home. 80.782 - We have an infant and we're trying to make sure 83.901 - that everything gets done that needs done. 86.725 - And life is really, really busy. 92.357 - And a couple of weeks into this amazing experience, 96.718 - when the sleep deprivation really kicked in, 100.247 - like around week eight, 102.299 - I had this thought, and it was the same thought 105.732 - that parents across the ages, internationally, 109.773 - everybody has had this thought, which is: 112.467 - I am never going to have free time ever again. 118.054 - (Laughter) 119.183 - Somebody said it's true. 122.403 - It's not exactly true, 125.214 - but it feels really, really true in that moment. 129.866 - And this was really disconcerning to me, 132.075 - because one of the things that I enjoy 135.484 - more than anything else is learning new things. 139.428 - Getting curious about something and diving in 142.261 - and fiddling around and  learning through trial and error. 145.164 - And eventually becoming pretty good at something. 148.44 - And without this free time, 152.336 - I didn't know how I was ever  going to do that ever again. 156.405 - And so, I'm a big geek, 158.877 - I want to keep learning things, I want to keep growing. 162.07 - And so what I've decided to do was, 165.087 - go to the library, and go to the bookstore, 167.784 - and look at what research says about 169.922 - how we learn and how we learn quickly. 173.523 - And I read a bunch of books, I read a bunch of websites. 176.834 - And tried to answer this question, 179.091 - how long does it take to acquire a new skill? 183.04 - You know what I found? 185.117 - 10,000 hours! 189.438 - Anybody ever heard this? 191.2 - It takes 10,000 hours. If you want to learn something new, 194.134 - if you want to be good at it, 195.584 - it's going to take 10,000 hours to get there. 197.934 - And I read this in book after book, in website after website. 201.455 - And my mental experience of reading all of this stuff was like: 208.421 - No!! 210.799 - I don't have time! I don't have 10,000 hours. 214.539 - I am never going to be able to learn anything new. 219.088 - Ever again. (Laughter) 222.421 - But that's not true. 223.479 - So, 10,000 hours, just to give you a rough order of magnitude, 226.559 - 10,000 hours is a full-time job for five years. 232.422 - That's a long time. 234.008 - And we've all had the experience of learning something new, 236.364 - and it didn't take us anywhere close to that amount of time, right? 240.439 - So, what's up? There's something kinda funky going on here. 243.505 - What the research says and what we expect, and have experiences, 247.078 - they don't match up. 249.416 - And what I found, here's the wrinkle: 252.993 - The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies of expert-level performance. 259.722 - There's a professor at Florida State University, 262.228 - his name is K. Anders Ericsson. 264.226 - He is the originator of the 10,00 hour rule. 266.725 - And where that came from is, he studied professional athletes, 271.261 - world class musicians, chess grand masters. 275.763 - All of this ultra competitive folks in ultra-high performing fields. 280.775 - And he tried to figure out how long does it take 283.751 - to get to the top of those kinds of fields. 286.811 - And what he found is, the more deliberate practice, 289.668 - the more time that those individuals spend 292.194 - practicing the elements of whatever it is that they do, 295.304 - the more time you spend, the better you get. 297.246 - And the folks at the tippy top of their fields 300.165 - put in around 10,000 hours of practice. 305.101 - Now, we were talking about the game of telephone a little bit earlier. 309.442 - Here's what happened: 311.236 - an author by the name of Malcolm Gladwell 313.458 - wrote a book in 2007 called \"Outliers: The Story of Success\", 317.901 - and the central piece of that book was the 10,000 hour rule. 321.592 - Practice a lot, practice well, and you will do extremely well, 325.642 - you will reach the top of your field. 327.367 - So, the message, 329.472 - what Dr. Ericsson was actually saying is, 332.455 - it takes 10,000 hours to get at the top of an ultra competitive field 337.425 - in a very narrow subject, that's what that means. 341.857 - But here's what happened: ever since Outliers came out, 345.294 - immediately came out, reached the top of best seller lists, 347.449 - stayed there for three solid months. 350.056 - All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rule was everywhere. 354.171 - And a society-wide game of telephone started to be played. 360.022 - So this message, it takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field, 364.955 - became, it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something, 369.927 - which became, 371.366 - it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something, 375.667 - which became, 377.192 - it takes 10,000 hours to learn something. 381.455 - But that last statement, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something, 385.337 - is not true. It's not true. 388.6 - So, what the research actually says -- 393.346 - I spent a lot of time here at the CSU library 396.217 - in the cognitive psychology stacks 'cause I'm a geek. 399.523 - And when you actually look at the studies of skill acquisition, 404.216 - you see over and over a graph like this. 408.039 - Now, researchers, whether they're studying a motor skill, 411.694 - something you do physically or a mental skill, 414.328 - they like to study things that they can time. 417.174 - 'Cause you can quantify that, right? 419.185 - So, they'll give research participants a little task, 422.452 - something that requires physical arrangement, 424.156 - or something that requires learning a little mental trick, 428.925 - and they'll time how long a participant takes to complete the skill. 433.357 - And here's what this graph says, when you start -- 436.095 - so when researchers gave participants a task, it took them a really long time, 440.398 - 'cause it was new and they were horrible. 443.053 - With a little bit of practice, they get better and better and better. 446.651 - And that early part of practice is really, really efficient. 450.632 - People get good at things with just a little bit of practice. 456.021 - Now, what's interesting to note is that, 459.663 - for skills that we want to learn for ourselves, 462.869 - we don't care so much about time, right? 465.736 - We just care about how good we are, whatever good happens to mean. 469.283 - So if we relabel performance time to how good you are, 474.943 - the graph flips, and you get his famous and widely known, 479.346 - this is the learning curve. 481.274 - And the story of the learning curve is when you start, 483.852 - you're grossly incompetent and you know it, right? 486.567 - (Laughter) 488.635 - With a little bit of practice, you get really good, really quick. 491.997 - So that early level of improvement is really fast. 495.715 - And then at a certain point you reach a plateau, 498.63 - and the subsequent games become much harder to get, 501.96 - they take more time to get. 504.659 - Now, my question is, I want that, right? 508.62 - How long does it take from starting something 511.605 - and being grossly incompetent and knowing it 515.265 - to being reasonably good? 517.575 - In hopefully, as short a period of time as possible. 522.329 - So, how long does that take? 524.539 - Here's what my research says: 20 hours. 529.518 - That's it. You can go from knowing nothing 533.163 - about any skill that you can think of. 535.739 - Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to draw? 539.175 - Want to learn how to juggle flaming chainsaws? 542.294 - (Laughter) 543.32 - If you put 20 hours of focused deliberate practice into that thing, 548.532 - you will be astounded. 550.964 - Astounded at how good you are. 554.135 - 20 hours is doable, 555.645 - that's about 45 minutes a day for about a month. 559.956 - Even skipping a couple days, here and there. 562.066 - 20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate. 565.221 - Now, there's a method to doing this. 568.1 - Because it's not like you can just start fiddling around for about 20 hours 571.097 - and expect these massive improvements. 573.044 - There's a way to practice intelligently. 575.713 - There's a way to practice efficiently, 577.997 - that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours 581.051 - in the most effective way that you possibly can. 583.592 - And here's the method, it applies to anything: 587.518 - The first is to deconstruct the skill. 591.363 - Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done, 596.262 - and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces. 602.072 - Most of the things that we think of as skills 606.042 - are actually big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things. 610.639 - The more you can break apart the skill, 614.211 - the more you're able to decide, 616.583 - what are the parts of this skill that would actually help me 618.974 - get to what I want? 621.365 - And then you can practice those first. 623.758 - And if you practice the most important things first, 625.96 - you'll be able to improve your performance 628.731 - in the least amount of time possible. 631.502 - The second is, learn enough to self correct. 634.273 - So, get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn. 638.467 - Could be book, could be DVDs, could be courses, could be anything. 643.719 - But don't use those as a way to procrastinate on practice. 648.95 - I know I do this, right? 650.585 - Get like 20 books about the topic, like, 652.661 - \"I'm going to start learning how to program a computer 655.138 - when I complete these 20 books\". 657.615 - No. That's procrastination. 660.094 - What you want to do is learn just enough 664.141 - that you can actually practice 665.85 - and self correct or self edit as you practice. 670.914 - So the learning becomes a way of getting better 673.819 - at noticing when you're making a mistake 676.724 - and then doing something a little different. 679.63 - The third is to remove barriers to practice. 684.106 - Distractions, television, internet. 686.55 - All of these things that get in the way 689.929 - of you actually sitting down and doing the work. 693.308 - And the more you're able to use just a little bit of willpower 696.689 - to remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing, 699.887 - the more likely you are to actually sit down and practice, right? 706.27 - And the fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. 711.473 - Now, most skills have what I call a frustration barrier. 714.77 - You know, the grossly-incompetent- and-knowing-it part? 718.078 - That's really, really frustrating. We don't like to feel stupid. 722.374 - And feeling stupid is a barrier to us  actually sitting down and doing the work. 727.314 - So, by pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do 731.762 - for at least 20 hours, 734.378 - you will be able to overcome that initial frustration barrier 738.918 - and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards. 743.029 - That's it! It's not rocket science. 745.368 - Four very simple steps that you can use to learn anything. 751.466 - Now, this is easy to talk about in theory, 755.302 - but it's more fun to talk about in practice. 757.703 - So one of the things that I've wanted to learn how to do for a long time 761.964 - is play the ukulele. 764.163 - Has anybody seen Jake Shimabukuro's TEDTalk 767.787 - where he plays the ukulele and makes it sound like -- 770.901 - he's like a ukulele god. 772.26 - It's amazing. 774.026 - I saw it, I was like, \"That is so cool!\" 777.206 - It's such a neat instrument. I would really like to learn how to play. 781.373 - And so I decided that to test this theory 783.96 - I wanted to put 20 hours into practicing ukulele 787.636 - and see where it got. 789.819 - And so the first thing about playing the ukulele is, 793.635 - in order to practice, you have to have one, right? 797.701 - So, I got an ukulele and -- My lovely assistant? 801.791 - (Laughter) 804.526 - Thank you sir. I think I need the chord here. 811.58 - It's not just an ukulele, it's an electric ukulele. (Laughter) 815.569 - Yeah. 820.635 - So, the first couple hours are just like the first couple hours of anything. 825.195 - You have to get the tools that you are using to practice. 828.554 - You have to make sure they're available. 830.616 - My ukulele didn't come with strings attached. 832.582 - I had to figure out how to put those on. 834.548 - Like, that's kind of important, right? 836.515 - And learning how to tune, learning how to make sure 838.468 - that all of the things that need to be done 840.321 - in order to start practicing get done, right? 844.515 - Now, one of the things when I was ready to actually start practicing 851.187 - was I looked in online databases and songbooks for how to play songs. 855.996 - And they say, okay, ukuleles, you can play more than one string at a time, 859.088 - so you can play chords, that's cool, 860.969 - you are accompanying yourself, yay you. (Laughter) 864.242 - And when I started looking at songs, 868.356 - I had an ukulele chord book that had like hundreds of chords. 872.471 - Looking at this and \"Wow, that's intimidating\". 875.534 - But when you look at the actual songs, 877.859 - you see the same chords over and over, right? 882.71 - As it turns out, playing the ukulele is kind of like doing anything, 886.299 - There's a very small set of things that are really important 889.552 - and techniques that you'll use all the time. 892.422 - And in most songs you'll use four, maybe five chords, 898.42 - and that's it, that's the song. 900.229 - You don't have to know hundreds, as long as you know the four or the five. 904.993 - So, while I was doing my research, 906.813 - I found a wonderful little medley of pop songs 911.264 - by a band called Axis of Awesome. (Whistles) 916.178 - -- Somebody knows it. -- 919.199 - And what Axis of Awesome says is that you can learn, 923.418 - or you can play pretty much any pop song of the past five decades, 927.017 - if you know four chords, 928.685 - and those chords are G, D, Em and C. 933.062 - Four chords pump out every pop song ever, right? 937.931 - So I thought, this is cool! 939.401 - I would like to play every pop song ever. (Laughter) 942.584 - So, that was the first song I decided to learn, 945.627 - and I would like to actually share it with you. Ready? 949.445 - (Applause) Alright. 951.423 - (Music) 963.6 - (Singing) Just a small town girl, 966.104 - living in a lonely world, 968.878 - she took the midnight train going anywhere. 974.652 - I heard that you settled down, (Laughter) 978.209 - that you found a girl, 981.672 - that you're married now. 985.013 - Every night in my dreams (Laughter) 987.323 - I see you, I feel you, 990.496 - that is how I know you go on. (Laughter) 996.253 - I won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours. 1002.227 - 'Cause you were amazing, we did amazing things. 1007.6 - If I could, then I would, I'd go wherever you will -- 1012.682 - Can you feel the love tonight. (Laughter) 1018.244 - I can't live with or without you. 1023.4 - When I find myself -- 1025.19 - When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me, 1027.489 - Sometimes I feel like I don't have partner. No woman, no cry. 1031.865 - Yeah mama, this surely is a dream. 1033.504 - I come from a land down under. (Laughter) 1035.836 - Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong. 1038.863 - Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, (Laughter) 1042.253 - but here's my number, so call me 1046.413 - Hey sexy lady, op, op, op, op, oppan gangnam style. (Laughter) 1050.19 - It's time to say goodbye. 1055.932 - Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end. 1065.79 - (Singing and music ends) (Applause) 1076.911 - Thank you, thank you. 1083.013 - I love that song. (Laughter) 1087.395 - And I have a secret to share with you. 1090.499 - So, by playing that song for you, 1094.471 - I just hit my twentieth hour of practicing the ukulele. 1099.221 - (Applause) Thank you. 1104.933 - And so it's amazing, pretty much anything that you can think of, 1108.974 - what do you want to do. 1110.752 - The major barrier to learn something new is not intellectual, 1115.317 - it's not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things. 1120.998 - The major barrier's emotional. We're scared. 1124.753 - Feeling stupid doesn't feel good, 1127.014 - in the beginning of learning anything new 1129.275 - you feel really stupid. 1131.537 - So the major barrier's not intellectual, it's emotional. 1135.633 - But put 20 hours into anything. 1138.971 - It doesn't matter. What do you want to learn? 1141.377 - Do you want to learn a language? Want to learn how to cook? 1144.848 - Want to learn how to draw? 1147.114 - What turns you on? What lights you up? 1150.86 - Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20 hours. 1154.747 - Have fun. 1156.093 - (Applause)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Life-Changing Parenthood 1:15 - The Challenges of Learning as a Busy Parent 3:40 - The Myth of the 10,000-Hour Rule 5:30 - The Origins of the 10,000-Hour Rule 7:30 - The True Path to Skill Acquisition 9:40 - The 20-Hour Learning Method 11:00 - Steps to Learn Any Skill Quickly 13:15 - Putting the Method to Practice: Learning Ukulele 15:30 - The Emotional Barrier to Learning 17:00 - Closing Thoughts: What Will You Learn?"}]}

I,   5.72 - like a lot of people looking at  getting these, had some questions like:   9.64 - What is the point of these if you're not an  Instagram influencer or you just don't care   14.16 - about posting to social media? And would I  use them enough to justify the cost? Well,   19.52 - 6 months later, I now know  the answer to both questions. 25.04 - So the first highlight of these glasses is  their design. Meta and Ray-Ban have done   30.4 - something pretty remarkable here. They've created  a wearable that looks like something people are   35.52 - already wearing. I have walked by and talked  with countless people over the past 6 months   40.84 - while wearing these glasses, and like one person  realized what they actually were. The only real   46.92 - giveaway is the camera, and the sides are  slightly thicker. Meta Ray-Bans come in a   52.28 - few different styles: Headliner, Wayfarer (which  is what I have), and a couple others. And yes,   58.52 - you can get them with prescription lenses,  and you can even get transition lenses,   63.84 - either prescription or non-prescription,  though they'll cost you an extra $50 to $80. 69.96 - So how exactly do these work and  what makes them smart glasses? Well,   74.76 - they have an integrated camera, they have  open-ear speakers on each side of the glasses,   80.92 - and they have the Meta AI built into them.  In terms of controls, you've got a capture   85.72 - button on the top right for photos and videos,  a touchpad on the right side for volume control,   91.28 - skipping tracks, and triggering the assistant,  and you can even use them to trigger Spotify,   96.04 - Apple Music, or Amazon Music  with a single tap. Also note,   100.08 - Apple Music is only available on the  iPhone version of The Meta View app. 104.76 - The glasses come with an IPX4 water resistance  rating, so you don't have to worry if you get   110.36 - caught in light rain, and I was able to  wear them out kayaking in the Sound with   114.76 - no problem. You just wipe them off after  they get a bit wet, though note they're   119.16 - not designed to stay in the rain or sustain  splashes for hours or anything like that. 126.32 - Now, one of the most crucial aspects of the  glasses is the speakers. The sound quality is   132.4 - surprisingly decent. I found over the past 6  months that I've reached for my earbuds a bit   138.48 - less while wearing these, especially when all I'm  looking for is just some background music. One of   144.16 - my favorite use cases is transitioning music  playing from my car to the glasses with just a   149.52 - single tap. The glasses also have a five-mic  system, which is excellent for phone calls. 155.68 - All right, and this is how the mic  sounds for the Meta Ray-Bans. Let me   160.4 - know what you think in the comments.  How do you think these mics sound? 164.28 - So the AI thing, what exactly can  Meta AI and this assistant do? Well,   170.56 - I'd break it down into two categories. One  is more task-oriented. This is going to be   176.0 - more familiar to you if you're familiar  with like Apple and Google's assistants.   180.12 - So that's things like hands-free phone calls, you  can ask these to take a photo for you, send a text   186.24 - message to somebody in your contacts, play music,  and more. You can also use it to send messages to   192.04 - your contacts in both WhatsApp and Messenger,  or add videos directly to your Instagram Story. 198.36 - The second thing the AI assistant is for  is having general conversations with,   203.24 - and you can pretty much ask it anything like  general search queries. So, for example,   209.12 - here: \"What zones do pawpaw trees grow in?\" 214.56 - Pawpaw trees can grow in Raleigh, North Carolina,   217.6 - as it falls within USDA zone 8,  which is suitable for their growth. 224.32 - There you go. It'll even do proactive things for  you with the media quality check feature. It'll   229.8 - tell you when someone in a photo has their face  covered by hair or if your camera lens is dirty. 235.8 - And speaking of the camera, that's where things on  these glasses get really interesting. The glasses   241.2 - pack a 12-megapixel camera, and while that might  not sound impressive in the age of 50-megapixel   247.32 - smartphone camera sensors, the quality is  surprisingly good. The colors are pretty accurate,   253.4 - and the HDR processing doesn't go overboard  like it does on many modern smartphone cameras. 259.68 - What's really cool about having a camera in  your glasses is the unique vantage point,   264.72 - like when I was kayaking in The Sound. The Meta  Ray-Bans were perfect for capturing moments when   269.84 - I was on the water, or even when we kayaked to an  island in the middle of the sound and my brother   275.12 - found this little shrimp in his boat. In the  amount of time I would have spent fumbling for   279.76 - my phone, I would have missed capturing that  moment that I was able to with the glasses. 285.6 - Now, will these replace your smartphone  camera or fancy dedicated camera? No,   290.56 - not for serious photography at least, but for  capturing spontaneous moments or when you're   295.68 - in situations where using other cameras isn't  practical, that's where the Meta Ray-Bans shine. 301.92 - There are some constraints though to keep  in mind with this camera system. Videos   306.6 - are limited to 3 minutes, though I  usually keep mine at 60 seconds to   310.84 - conserve battery. Another limitation of the  camera system is the aspect ratio for both   316.48 - photos and videos. It's fixed in a portrait  orientation, which might not always be ideal. 323.2 - Now, what about battery life and how do you  charge the glasses? The glasses come with   328.08 - this nice leather Ray-Ban case that doubles as  a charger. There's a USB-C port on the bottom,   334.36 - and the glasses themselves charge via pin  connectors in the nose bridge. Meta claims   339.4 - 4 hours of battery life on a single charge and  up to 36 hours with the case. In my experience,   345.92 - that's been pretty accurate. I took these on a  day trip to Cape Lookout, and they lasted about   351.36 - between 4 and 5 hours, and I was taking a lot of  photos and videos. They're also pretty quick to   357.6 - recharge. You'll get about 30 to 40% capacity  with just a 15-minute charge in the case. 364.64 - So what features have I found myself not really  using with these glasses? While I use the Meta   370.16 - assistant for basic tasks like controlling  media, phone calls, etc., I haven't found   374.68 - myself using its deeper capabilities like  having conversations with it or asking it   379.76 - to identify what you're looking at. I have tried  that feature a lot, especially when it first came   384.48 - out. I tried to use it to identify what kind of  tree am I looking at, and it would just tell me,   389.96 - \"You're looking at a tree with green leaves,\" and  I'm like, \"Okay, thanks, that was not helpful.\" 394.84 - I also haven't used the direct sharing features  much. It's there if you want it, but it hasn't   400.0 - been a go-to for me since outside of my job, I  don't post or check social media all that often. 407.04 - So what are the downsides I've encountered while  using the Meta Ray-Bans? The main one involves the   412.36 - Meta AI assistant. It just has some limitations.  It couldn't identify songs currently playing off   419.2 - my iPhone, and it won't let you directly reply  to a text that it's reading aloud. And when you   425.16 - ask it to play a song on Apple Music, it'll play  that song but nothing after it. The integration   430.68 - with your phone's operating system isn't as  seamless as you want it to be, and it really   434.8 - makes me curious how much better the experience  would be if these glasses were made by Apple or   440.44 - Google. And it also makes you aware of how locked  down these phone operating systems still are. 446.8 - Also, because Meta AI is a large language learning  model like ChatGPT and all of these other chatbots   452.68 - out there, it can just confidently lie  to you when it gives you an answer,   457.92 - which makes the being able to ask  it just for information that feature   463.4 - a bit useless because I don't trust it  to actually give me the correct answer. 468.08 - Battery life is another downside. I  think closer to 8 hours would be ideal,   472.76 - especially for long days where you're  outside and you don't necessarily want   476.32 - to have to put the glasses back in  their case to charge for 15 minutes. 480.68 - Another downside is when taking photos, there's  a slight 1 to 2 second delay when you press the   486.84 - button and when the photo is actually taken,  which can be frustrating because people will   491.88 - often think you already took the photo and start  moving before the photo has actually been snapped. 497.08 - The last downside with these glasses is while  they are comfortable, if you wear them for   501.24 - several hours, I've at least noticed that my  ears will get a little bit sore as you kind   505.6 - of just feel the weight of them a little bit.  And while it's not sore enough to make me not   510.88 - want to wear these as sunglasses, not at all, but  I do still hope that Meta and Ray-Ban are able to   516.96 - make these a little bit lighter and the sides  a little bit slimmer in the next generation. 522.56 - So would I recommend getting a pair of the Meta  Ray-Ban smart glasses? I was skeptical at first,   528.32 - but these glasses have genuinely surprised  me. They're great for trips, adventures,   533.32 - or just capturing everyday moments. The  camera quality is decent considering it's   538.52 - built into a pair of sunglasses, and the overall  experience of using them is just fun. So yes,   545.6 - I would recommend them, but for whom, you may ask? 548.44 - Well, if you're the type of person who  just loses sunglasses really easily,   553.88 - these probably are not for you. Unlike items  like AirPods, there's no Find My or tracking   559.6 - these if they get lost, and since there's no  fingerprint sensor or other authentication   564.44 - method for the glasses, they'd be pretty  easy for thieves to steal and reuse.   569.68 - That's something Meta should  definitely address in future versions. 573.32 - How I look at these is if you're already in the  market for a pair of $200 designer sunglasses,   579.16 - well, for just $100 more, you get  an integrated camera, speakers,   583.64 - and an assistant, and to me,  that's a pretty easy upsell. 588.4 - Now another question a lot of people ask when  looking at these is should you get the version   592.56 - with transition lenses so you can just keep  wearing them as you come inside? That depends   598.12 - on two things: One, you prefer noise cancellation  when you're inside working and/or taking calls,   603.36 - and two, how much do you think you'll really  benefit from having the integrated Meta   608.32 - AI assistant? If you're in a noisy  environment or just an environment   611.76 - you want that noise cancellation and you  don't care about the AI features as much,   616.04 - then I'd say just go for the sunglasses  version of these and save yourself some money. 620.8 - All in all, I've really come to enjoy the Meta  Ray-Ban smart glasses. They're one of the best   625.36 - wearables you can get that offer real value and  utility today. I only wish they could be more   631.32 - integrated with my phone and have slightly better  battery life, but it makes me really hopeful for   636.92 - the future of this category. Where these are today  is already pretty impressive, and I can't imagine   643.28 - all the things you'd be able to do with these  if they had embedded displays. For now though,   648.36 - I'm content just listening to music on these,  taking photos and videos, and sending someone an   654.24 - occasional text or taking a call from my glasses,  which is a pretty cool thing you can do now. 661.56 - I've left links to learn more about these  glasses and check their current price in   665.36 - the blog post for this video at 6monthslater.net.  Link in the description.

36.866 - This is the cycle of procrastination, and I promise you, we have all been there. 44.082 - But why do we keep procrastinating  even when we know it’s bad for us? 49.962 - To be clear, putting something off isn’t always procrastinating. 54.884 - Responsible time management requires deciding which tasks are important 59.388 - and which ones can wait. 61.057 - Procrastination is when we avoid a task  we said we would do, for no good reason, 66.729 - despite expecting our behavior  to bring negative consequences. 70.65 - Obviously, it’s irrational to do something you expect to harm you. 75.238 - But ironically, procrastination is the  result of our bodies trying to protect us, 81.869 - specifically by avoiding a task  we see as threatening. 86.999 - When you realize you need to write that report, 89.585 - your brain responds like it would to any incoming threat. 93.798 - Your amygdala, a set of neurons  involved in emotional processing 97.885 - and threat identification, 99.637 - releases hormones including adrenaline that kick off a fear response. 105.309 - This stress-induced panic can overpower the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, 110.773 - which typically help you think  long term and regulate your emotions. 115.069 - And it’s in the midst of this fight, flight, or freeze response 119.198 - that you decide to handle the threat 121.117 - by avoiding it in favor of some less stressful task. 125.329 - This response might seem extreme— 128.124 - after all, it’s just a deadline, not a bear attack. 131.335 - But we’re most likely to procrastinate tasks that evoke negative feelings, 136.257 - such as dread, incompetence, and insecurity. 140.136 - Studies of procrastinating university students have found participants 144.473 - were more likely to put off tasks they perceived as stressful or challenging. 149.478 - And the perception of how difficult the task is 152.356 - increases while you’re putting it off. 155.776 - In one experiment, students were given reminders to study throughout the day. 161.115 - While they were studying, most reported that it wasn’t so bad. 164.785 - But when they were procrastinating, 166.787 - they consistently rated the idea of studying as very stressful, 171.918 - making it difficult to get started. 175.004 - Because procrastination is motivated by our negative feelings, 178.799 - some individuals are more susceptible to it than others. 182.762 - People who have difficulty regulating their emotions 185.473 - and those who struggle  with low self-esteem 188.017 - are much more likely to procrastinate, 190.686 - regardless of how good they are at time management. 194.148 - However, it's a common misconception that all procrastinators are lazy. 200.529 - In the body and brain, laziness is marked by no energy and general apathy. 206.786 - When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more likely to sit around doing nothing 210.456 - than distract yourself  with unimportant tasks. 213.876 - In fact, many people procrastinate because they care too much. 219.298 - Procrastinators often report a high fear of failure, 223.052 - putting things off because they’re afraid their work 225.846 - won’t live up to their high standards. 228.808 - Whatever the reason for procrastination,  the results are often the same. 233.813 - Frequent procrastinators are likely  to suffer from anxiety and depression, 238.484 - ongoing feelings of shame, 240.319 - higher stress levels and physical ailments associated with high stress. 245.866 - Worst of all, while procrastination hurts us in the long run, 249.787 - it does temporarily reduce our stress level, 253.457 - reinforcing it as a bodily response for coping with stressful tasks. 258.963 - So, how can we break the cycle of procrastination? 263.843 - Traditionally, people thought  procrastinators needed to cultivate 267.513 - discipline and practice  strict time management. 271.183 - But today, many researchers feel the exact opposite. 275.479 - Being too hard on yourself can layer additional bad emotions onto a task, 280.192 - making the threat even more intense. 283.404 - To short-circuit this stress response, 285.698 - we need to address and reduce these negative emotions. 290.619 - Some simple strategies include breaking a task into smaller elements 295.249 - or journaling about why it's stressing you out 297.835 - and addressing those underlying concerns. 301.464 - Try removing nearby distractions that make it easy to impulsively procrastinate. 307.136 - And more than anything, it helps to cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, 312.099 - forgiving yourself, and making a plan to do better next time. 317.188 - Because a culture that perpetuates this cycle of stress and procrastination 322.151 - hurts all of us in the long term."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: The Cycle of Procrastination 0:36 - What is Procrastination?
