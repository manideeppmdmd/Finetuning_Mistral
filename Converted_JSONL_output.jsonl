hey friends I'm Aliena and welcome back to\u00a0 my channel so in the past four months or so\u00a0\u00a0 5.52 - I finished another Google certificate course\u00a0 and this one it is the digital marketing and\u00a0\u00a0 11.22 - e-commerce certificate I took this course because\u00a0 I work in the e-commerce industry so for those of\u00a0\u00a0 17.04 - you who consider taking the course I want to\u00a0 break down what is exactly in these courses\u00a0\u00a0 21.9 - and I want to let you know whether I think it\u00a0 is worth it or not first of all this is a large\u00a0\u00a0 27.96 - certificate course it's not just one certificate\u00a0 it also has seven smaller certificates so there\u00a0\u00a0 33.48 - are seven courses in total you can also just take\u00a0 one course and then get that certificate and it's\u00a0\u00a0 39.9 - not a course that you can finish in one sitting\u00a0 you need to plan to spend months on the courses\u00a0\u00a0 45.96 - to finish everything there will be videos readings\u00a0 quizzes and activities you'll be doing throughout\u00a0\u00a0 53.46 - the courses if you can pay for the course I will\u00a0 recommend you to pay for the Coursera plus plan\u00a0\u00a0 60.18 - because that one you can not only take this\u00a0 course you can take also any other course in\u00a0\u00a0 65.76 - coursera whenever there's a sale going on I'll be\u00a0 putting the link to my description if you cannot\u00a0\u00a0 72.3 - afford the course no worries at all you can audit\u00a0 it for free or you can apply for a financial aid\u00a0\u00a0 79.44 - let me quickly break down each course for you so\u00a0 that you don't have to waste time thinking about\u00a0\u00a0 84.54 - which one should I take and which one should\u00a0 I skip course one is about the fundamentals\u00a0\u00a0 89.76 - of digital marketing and e-commerce and by the\u00a0 way digital marketing and e-commerce are two\u00a0\u00a0 94.86 - different things but this course just decide to\u00a0 put them together and teach you at the same time\u00a0\u00a0 99.84 - so course one I would suggest everyone to take\u00a0 because that's the fundamental it will run you\u00a0\u00a0 104.88 - through the digital marketing funnel it will\u00a0 explain to you what is the difference between\u00a0\u00a0 109.62 - paid media versus owned media versus\u00a0 earned media different types of ads\u00a0\u00a0 114.24 - SEO and then types of marketing campaign for\u00a0 course 2 it's more heavily focused on SEO and\u00a0\u00a0 121.98 - ads so if you work in the industry related to\u00a0 advertising or SEO this could be good for you\u00a0\u00a0 129.78 - course 3 is about social media marketing so if\u00a0 you want to learn about social media marketing\u00a0\u00a0 134.28 - or do anything social media marketing related\u00a0 take this one it also covers ads on social media\u00a0\u00a0 140.04 - advertising people you can check out the later\u00a0 part of this course the fourth course is all\u00a0\u00a0 145.2 - about email marketing so if you get a job that's\u00a0 highly related to email marketing take this course\u00a0\u00a0 151.32 - or if you want to learn about how to use email\u00a0 to grow your small business take this course\u00a0\u00a0 157.08 - course five is about marketing or marketing\u00a0 analysis and a little bit about Google ads\u00a0\u00a0 163.62 - this course is slightly more technical you will\u00a0 see a lot of data and dashboard so for those of\u00a0\u00a0 171.84 - you that like numbers data analysis take this\u00a0 one course six is about starting an e-commerce\u00a0\u00a0 178.56 - store especially on Shopify and it also touches\u00a0 a little bit on advertising so if you want to\u00a0\u00a0 184.56 - start a Shopify store yourself or if you want to\u00a0 learn more about e-commerce* and ads take this\u00a0\u00a0 189.72 - course and finally course 7 is about customer\u00a0 loyalty how to write a great resume so if you\u00a0\u00a0 197.34 - want to get a job take this course now regarding\u00a0 what I liked about the course first of all the\u00a0\u00a0 205.26 - breadth of the course was mind-blowing I feel\u00a0 like I learned so many different things because\u00a0\u00a0 210.42 - I've also taken other Coursera Google courses\u00a0 right like the ux design one data analysis one\u00a0\u00a0 215.4 - and the PM course from Google those are more\u00a0 specific designed for one type of job but this\u00a0\u00a0 222.12 - course brought your knowledge about the entire\u00a0 industry I definitely feel like I've learned a lot\u00a0\u00a0 229.08 - and just like what Google always does the video\u00a0 quality is really good I really enjoy looking at\u00a0\u00a0 236.34 - high quality video and short videos so most of\u00a0 the things are like five minutes long it's just\u00a0\u00a0 242.34 - way better than listen to a lecture for three\u00a0 hours so for that part I highly enjoyed another\u00a0\u00a0 250.32 - thing that Google and Coursera really do well is\u00a0 that they'll bring interactive activity in this\u00a0\u00a0 256.14 - learning process so even if the video is just five\u00a0 minutes long you'll still see questions popping\u00a0\u00a0 261.66 - up in the middle of the video that test your\u00a0 knowledge on what you just saw and this course\u00a0\u00a0 266.34 - brings you a lot of great resources either it is\u00a0 links to things that you can learn deeper on or\u00a0\u00a0 273.12 - it's just like layouts of different job titles in\u00a0 this industry other than that there's also a lot\u00a0\u00a0 279.9 - of practice in the course Coursera and Google\u00a0 always bring good activity good scenarios so\u00a0\u00a0 286.68 - make sure you read through those scenarios don't\u00a0 skip the activity those are really really spot on\u00a0\u00a0 291.72 - now moving to what I disliked about the course\u00a0 as I said before I think the course touches on\u00a0\u00a0 298.14 - many many things it kind of made me feel like the\u00a0 knowledge is a little bit scattered so I almost\u00a0\u00a0 304.86 - will suggest you to take the first course and then\u00a0 directly jump to the one that you want to learn\u00a0\u00a0 310.5 - the most and after that you can just take your\u00a0 time and look through the other videos for example\u00a0\u00a0 316.26 - if you only want to learn about email marketing\u00a0 I'm not sure whether going through all the details\u00a0\u00a0 321.72 - about like ads* dashboards Google ads will help\u00a0 you too much another thing that I kind of disliked\u00a0\u00a0 328.8 - is that they mixed together digital marketing\u00a0 and e-commerce too much that I forgot to think\u00a0\u00a0 333.42 - about oh there's actually a difference between\u00a0 digital marketing and e-commerce I work in the\u00a0\u00a0 338.04 - e-commerce industry because I work for eBay but\u00a0 at the same time me doing YouTube channel is some\u00a0\u00a0 344.46 - sort of digital marketing for myself and I somehow\u00a0 want to separate the concept a bit more you know\u00a0\u00a0 350.94 - so when you're taking the course please keep in\u00a0 mind that even though the brand digital marketing\u00a0\u00a0 355.56 - and e-commerce together it's still not entirely\u00a0 the same and finally I want to say that I don't\u00a0\u00a0 362.22 - think this certificate will help you too much if\u00a0 your goal is to start an e-commerce store yourself\u00a0\u00a0 366.84 - because this course is more on the knowledge side\u00a0 of thing instead of the practice side of thing\u00a0\u00a0 372.9 - if you want to start an e-commerce store\u00a0 you will have to import you will have to\u00a0\u00a0 377.52 - take photos check the price communicate\u00a0 with the buyers and that I think really\u00a0\u00a0 383.22 - need practice instead of just pure knowledge\u00a0 but if your goal is to work in the digital\u00a0\u00a0 389.82 - marketing or e-commerce industry or if\u00a0 you already got a job in these industries\u00a0\u00a0 396.12 - I think this is a great place for you to be it\u00a0 just brings you so much knowledge you can talk\u00a0\u00a0 400.14 - about in those interviews but again knowledge is\u00a0 different from experience to get an actual job\u00a0\u00a0 407.22 - you still need to show you have experience just by\u00a0 showing you have a certificate will almost never\u00a0\u00a0 412.62 - get you a job and final advice for every single\u00a0 one of you the best way of finishing anything\u00a0\u00a0 419.34 - certificate course related* or learn anything is\u00a0 to dedicate 30 minutes every day that is my only\u00a0\u00a0 424.92 - strategy of finishing all these certificates\u00a0 in this year and I do not regret taking any\u00a0\u00a0 430.5 -

Nice! 87.177 - Now, once you've figured out  what problem you want to tackle, 89.534 - you need to do your research. 91.729 - You can start by just making  a list of questions you have 94.338 - and what information you need  to start answering them. 96.662 - You can also look around and find  what other things already exist 99.0 - that have tried to solve this same problem. 101.538 - Maybe they can be improved. 102.78 - A good example here is the man  who helped us blow stuff up. 106.017 - The chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel  invented the explosive known as dynamite. 110.57 - Not because he particularly enjoyed explosions, 112.78 - but because miners and other people who, 115.167 - well, needed to blow stuff up to do their jobs, 118.089 - needed an explosive that was safer to use. 120.4 - So, before he started on that problem, 122.569 - Nobel did research to see what  explosives already existed, 125.498 - which ones worked well,  and which ones didn't. 127.949 - This takes us to step 3: 130.008 - develop a solution. 131.182 - After your research is done, 132.512 - this is where you say exactly how you  think you can solve the problem, 135.936 - and once you've thought of a good solution, 137.757 - you have to figure out how it'll actually work 139.674 - and what it will look like, 141.154 - so you have to design your solution. 143.22 - This is where you get to draw! 144.958 - Civil engineers always sketch out their ideas 147.495 - like buildings and bridges and towers 149.746 - to show what they'll look like when they're done. 151.538 - Gustave Eiffel designed the famous  Eiffel Tower in France, 154.775 - and he definitely showed up  on day one of construction 157.404 - knowing exactly what it was gonna look like. 159.96 - On to step five: build a prototype. 162.695 - A prototype is just a simple model  that lets you test out your design. 166.215 - It can be as big as the real thing's going  to be or it can be a smaller version. 169.92 - You just need to have a prototype so you can test it! 172.709 - This may be the most important  step in the whole process. 175.793 - Engineers need to test their design  to see if it works like they want it to. 179.249 - So, say, if your building's a  big tower, does it stand up? 182.811 - Does it stay standing up? 184.491 - If you're designing something with moving parts,  does it work the way you want? 187.969 - Now, take it from me, my future engineers, 190.392 - you might have a great idea, a really  terrific solution to a really big problem, 195.687 - but when you get to this step your prototype  probably won't work exactly the way you want. 200.2 - At least, not on the first try. 202.092 - Most engineers test their prototypes  over and over and over again. 206.612 - That's why a lot of time and brainpower 209.068 - goes into the very last step: 211.072 - evaluating your solutions. 212.874 - \"Evaluating\" just means asking yourself  whether things are working the way you want, 217.351 - or why they are, or aren't. 219.65 - I like to think of this step  as \"question everything.\" 223.218 - This is when engineers review all of the  facts and ask themselves questions 226.557 - followed by even more questions. 228.94 - What worked well? 230.257 - Why did it work? 231.491 - Why didn't it work? 232.691 - How could it be made better? 234.634 - And, most of the time, 236.086 - the answers to these questions are  going to send you back several steps. 239.621 - Like, once you've figured out  why your prototype wasn't working, 242.872 - you'll have to design a new solution  and then build it and then test it again. 246.98 - Sometimes engineers go through this process  four, five, even six times or more. 252.448 - Take Willis Carrier, the inventor of modern air conditioning. 255.647 - He tested his prototypes for years before he figured  out the design that worked the way he wanted 260.4 - and solved the problem he wanted to fix. 262.774 - Like all engineers, he failed a lot before he succeeded, 266.315 - and that's okay because he learned  something from every failure, 270.08 - which made his product even better in the end. 272.452 - And I, for one, am glad he kept going. 274.946 - [Music] 278.76 - So, the engineering process is a  series of steps that engineers, 282.252 - or anyone, should use when  they're facing a challenge. 285.515 - The process is important because it allows  engineers to experiment and also to fail. 290.809 - Both of these things give engineers a chance  to go back and improve on their original idea, 295.447 - giving us something even better down the road. 297.897 - So, the next time you fail at  something, don't feel too bad. 301.266 - Think about the telephone and the  air conditioner and the Eiffel Tower, 304.846 - and then try again! 306.06 - [Music]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps:  0:00 - Introduction: The power of engineering 0:19 - What is the engineering process?

We have this interesting\u00a0 problem in America where we've applied the medical\u00a0\u00a0 46.38 - model to mental health, and it's created a lot\u00a0 of learned helplessness in our attempts to remove\u00a0\u00a0 51.36 - the stigma from mental health. Many people have\u00a0 come to believe that all mental illnesses are\u00a0\u00a0 56.7 - permanent genetic traits, and it's just not true.\u00a0 Anxiety disorders, depression, trauma and many\u00a0\u00a0 62.7 - other mental-health conditions are really really\u00a0 treatable. Now, I saw this in action when I worked\u00a0\u00a0 68.16 - in residential treatment. Clients would come\u00a0 in with severe depression, anxiety, trauma, and\u00a0\u00a0 73.08 - sometimes a bunch of other co-occurring diagnoses\u00a0 like substance use, learning differences, learning\u00a0\u00a0 78.06 - disorders, eating disorders, and and more.\u00a0 Right? Like many of my clients had six or eight\u00a0\u00a0 83.04 - diagnoses. And one of these programs did robust\u00a0 testing before and after treatment and found that\u00a0\u00a0 90.48 - at discharge, 93% of clients, they no longer met\u00a0 the criteria for depression or the issue that they\u00a0\u00a0 96.72 - originally came to treatment for. We also found\u00a0 that many of these results lasted for years after\u00a0\u00a0 102.6 - treatment. We saw people change in a massive way.\u00a0 They became so much healthier and happier. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 110.7 - granted, in residential treatment these clients\u00a0 were getting literally hundreds of interventions\u00a0\u00a0 115.32 - a week, from a daily schedule to exercise to\u00a0 nutrition to medical treatment. They got tons\u00a0\u00a0 120.48 - of support from professionals. Right? But you\u00a0 can create these changes too, little by little,\u00a0\u00a0 125.4 - as you apply one new skill at a time. So for\u00a0 many people depression, anxiety, or PTSD can\u00a0\u00a0 132.18 - be completely resolved, and for others the\u00a0 symptoms can be greatly reduced. Research shows\u00a0\u00a0 137.46 - that over 30% of people recover from depression\u00a0 without any treatment within six to eight weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 142.02 - and 80% recover within a year. So in this video\u00a0 we're going to talk about what a mental-health\u00a0\u00a0 147.12 - diagnosis really means and how an accurate\u00a0 understanding can open doors for you to change. 152.04 - [Music] Okay, let's start with a story. Once upon a 162.54 - time there was a huge\u00a0elephant. This\u00a0 elephant was super strong. He could 165.6 - uproot enormous trees and lift heavy logs.\u00a0 However, despite his extraordinary abilities,\u00a0\u00a0 171.42 - the elephant was held captive by a small\u00a0 rope tied around one of his legs. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 176.52 - one day a traveler approached the elephant's\u00a0 keeper and asked why this mighty creature didn't\u00a0\u00a0 181.38 - break free from the seemingly flimsy rope that\u00a0 held him back. The keeper explained, \"When the\u00a0\u00a0 188.1 - elephant was very young we used a similar rope\u00a0 to tie him up. At that age the rope was strong\u00a0\u00a0 194.82 - enough to hold it back. And as the elephant grew\u00a0 he never realized his own strength. He believed\u00a0\u00a0 199.92 - that he could never leave because of the rope.\"\u00a0 The truth is that this elephant had the ability\u00a0\u00a0 206.64 - inside to break free from this rope easily,\u00a0 but because he didn't believe that he could,\u00a0\u00a0 210.96 - he never did. This story is an example of learned\u00a0 helplessness. That baby elephant couldn't break\u00a0\u00a0 215.22 - the rope when he was tiny. And just like that,\u00a0 many people get overwhelmed by depression or\u00a0\u00a0 219.72 - anxiety when they don't have the support, the\u00a0 resources, or the skills. But unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0 224.16 - many people believe that they will never be able\u00a0 to overcome depression or anxiety, and because\u00a0\u00a0 229.74 - they believe they can't, they don't. Okay. Let's\u00a0 talk about where this huge misunderstanding came\u00a0\u00a0 235.02 - from. Let me give you an example of a diagnosis\u00a0 from the medical model. So let's say you have\u00a0\u00a0 239.76 - symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea, body aches,\u00a0 chills, and the doctor sees you and swabs your\u00a0\u00a0 245.64 - throat, the lab runs the test and diagnoses you\u00a0 as having the flu. That medical diagnosis means\u00a0\u00a0 251.04 - that the influenza virus is what's causing your\u00a0 symptoms. Now, if on the other hand you have\u00a0\u00a0 257.16 - symptoms like sadness, low energy, frequent crying\u00a0 spells, and you're feeling hopeless and suicidal,\u00a0\u00a0 263.88 - right, if you went to your doctor and you have at\u00a0 least five out of nine of these symptoms he would\u00a0\u00a0 268.8 - diagnose you with depression. But what's different\u00a0 about mental-health diagnoses is that when they\u00a0\u00a0 273.66 - say you have depression, they're not telling you\u00a0 anything about the cause of your symptoms; they're\u00a0\u00a0 280.08 - telling you, \"This cluster of symptoms, we in\u00a0 the scientific community, we call it depression,\u00a0\u00a0 285.3 - but we don't know what is causing it for you.\"\u00a0 They may give you a survey or an assessment that\u00a0\u00a0 290.88 - ranks your symptoms on a numerical scale with\u00a0 a clinical cutoff. So for example, if you take\u00a0\u00a0 295.08 - the Beck Depression Inventory and your score is\u00a0 over 20, you have moderate depression or higher,\u00a0\u00a0 301.08 - right? But again, all that's telling you is\u00a0 that you have these symptoms. It doesn't tell\u00a0\u00a0 305.52 - you the cause. A depression diagnosis is not the\u00a0 cause of your symptoms; it's the outcome of your\u00a0\u00a0 311.76 - symptoms. Now, right now we have a very limited\u00a0 way of understanding the individual biological\u00a0\u00a0 318.0 - factors that lead to depression. No doctor\u00a0 is going to scan your brain or extract brain\u00a0\u00a0 324.24 - fluid to diagnose depression. So the medical model\u00a0 doesn't perfectly fit mental health, and I think\u00a0\u00a0 330.48 - it confuses a lot of people. Many mental-health\u00a0 professionals prefer the biopsychosocial model.\u00a0\u00a0 335.4 - So to explain this I'm going to use depression as\u00a0 an example, but this really applies to most most\u00a0\u00a0 341.46 - mental-health conditions. So one of my favorite\u00a0 conceptualizations of depression is drawn from Dr.\u00a0\u00a0 346.14 - Charles Raison. He's a psychiatrist, a professor\u00a0 of psychiatry, and the co-author of the book The\u00a0\u00a0 352.26 - New Mind-Body Science of Depression. And I'm going\u00a0 to summarize what he says. He says depression\u00a0\u00a0 357.84 - doesn't exist as a single thing or cause.\u00a0 Its causes are incredibly complex. It may be\u00a0\u00a0 365.04 - 1,000 different disease states. It does exist.\u00a0 It is a real experience, and it's common to\u00a0\u00a0 370.5 - all the societies across the world, including\u00a0 hunter-gatherers. He says depression is the most\u00a0\u00a0 376.2 - common way humans break down under adversity. Now,\u00a0 I would I would change that just a little bit,\u00a0\u00a0 382.44 - and I would say the depression response is\u00a0 actually a chance for our body to rest and\u00a0\u00a0 386.22 - heal and recover and try something new when what\u00a0 we've been trying seems hopeless. So I take a\u00a0\u00a0 390.78 - little bit different approach to it, but this is\u00a0 how he describes it. And I believe that humans\u00a0\u00a0 396.18 - are actually inherently very resilient. We can\u00a0 handle a lot of adversity. But when your mind and\u00a0\u00a0 401.34 - body get overwhelmed, it's like your body shifts\u00a0 into this shutdown state for self-protection. And\u00a0\u00a0 407.22 - depression has many contributing factors. And in\u00a0 mine Change Your Brain course you learn that for\u00a0\u00a0 411.9 - some people their depression is contributed to by\u00a0 a nutrient deficiency or by a lack of sleep, and\u00a0\u00a0 417.3 - for other people their thoughts and actions lead\u00a0 to feeling hopeless or overwhelmed. Things like\u00a0\u00a0 424.26 - childhood trauma abuse and faulty thinking can\u00a0 also contribute to depression, but so can things\u00a0\u00a0 429.54 - like inflammation and allergies and loneliness.\u00a0 Then we also know that genetics are involved.\u00a0\u00a0 434.34 - So twin studies have shown us that depression is\u00a0 around 35% heritable, meaning that there's around\u00a0\u00a0 440.16 - a 35% chance that your genes are contributing\u00a0 to your depression. The estimates for anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 445.5 - are similar; they're somewhere between 27% and\u00a0 40%. Now, for some other mental health disorders,\u00a0\u00a0 451.38 - genes play a much bigger role. Research indicates\u00a0 that a genetic predisposition for depression might\u00a0\u00a0 457.68 - get turned on by life circumstances like abuse\u00a0 or trauma, but if 35% of depression is genetic,\u00a0\u00a0 463.56 - that also means that about 65% of the rest of\u00a0 contributing factors has to do with other causes.\u00a0\u00a0 470.64 - Now, this is actually really helpful because when\u00a0 we can decrease just a few of these hits we can\u00a0\u00a0 476.88 - actually often overcome depression. Now, we know\u00a0 that medication helps around 65% of people reduce\u00a0\u00a0 483.6 - the symptoms of depression, and research\u00a0 shows us that there are a ton of other\u00a0\u00a0 487.44 - effective treatments for depression too. So when\u00a0 we improve social connection or physical health,\u00a0\u00a0 493.08 - when we change thinking patterns or process trauma\u00a0 or improve nutrition, all of these factors can tip\u00a0\u00a0 500.22 - the scale toward no longer meeting the criteria\u00a0 for a diagnosis. Anxiety disorders are similar.\u00a0\u00a0 506.7 - They're caused by a combination of factors.\u00a0 And we can treat various aspects of anxiety,\u00a0\u00a0 511.32 - from the biological side of things to the\u00a0 psychological and behavioral side of things.\u00a0\u00a0 516.96 - So please don't automatically assume if\u00a0 you get a mental-health diagnosis that\u00a0\u00a0 523.26 - this is permanent. Don't assume that you're stuck\u00a0 feeling this way forever. It's just not the case,\u00a0\u00a0 528.78 - and it's not what a mental-health diagnosis\u00a0 really means. What I'd like for people to\u00a0\u00a0 532.92 - know is that a mental-health diagnosis does not\u00a0 mean you have this or you are this. It means you\u00a0\u00a0 541.26 - are experiencing this. Because a diagnosis doesn't\u00a0 tell you the cause. It doesn't say, \"You have this\u00a0\u00a0 547.02 - gene, and here's the cause.\" When we reduce or\u00a0 eliminate the symptoms of depression or anxiety,\u00a0\u00a0 551.64 - you no longer qualify for the diagnosis. So what\u00a0 I'm saying is that mental illness isn't always\u00a0\u00a0 557.16 - permanent. When we fuse our identity with\u00a0 our diagnosis, when we label ourselves as\u00a0\u00a0 562.2 - a depressed person or an anxious person, we limit\u00a0 our options. We create learned helplessness. Just\u00a0\u00a0 568.02 - like that elephant we tie ourselves down, we\u00a0 limit our potential, simply because we don't\u00a0\u00a0 573.3 - believe our life could be different than it is.\u00a0 And you'll see this when people who have over\u00a0\u00a0 577.8 - over-identified with their diagnosis, they\u00a0 might have a bad day and they might say, \"Oh,\u00a0\u00a0 582.24 - why is life so unfair? Why do I have to feel this\u00a0 way? Why do I feel so depressed? Why does it make\u00a0\u00a0 588.06 - me feel so awful?\" instead of a more flexible\u00a0 approach where they maybe look at what caused\u00a0\u00a0 594.36 - a bad day and exploring what options you have to\u00a0 make your life better. So when people use their\u00a0\u00a0 600.18 - diagnosis as an explanation for why they feel\u00a0 the way they do, it simply limits their options.\u00a0\u00a0 606.0 - Please don't resign yourself to just giving\u00a0 up, to feeling miserable for the rest of your\u00a0\u00a0 611.82 - life. Tiny changes can add up over time to huge\u00a0 results. So I would just say, like, let's keep\u00a0\u00a0 618.96 - chipping away at it. You don't know what you don't\u00a0 know. There's so many options for treatment. Like,\u00a0\u00a0 623.52 - let's learn what some of them are and try them\u00a0 out. I do want to say depression is real. It's not\u00a0\u00a0 628.2 - a weakness. It does have biological contributing\u00a0 factors. And by me saying, like, we're gonna shift\u00a0\u00a0 633.9 - away from this medical model, it doesn't mean that\u00a0 mental illness isn't real. It is is real. And most\u00a0\u00a0 639.06 - of the people I work with are doing everything\u00a0 they know to make things better, but the things\u00a0\u00a0 642.96 - they've tried in the past just aren't working. I\u00a0 want to clarify: mental illness is not laziness.\u00a0\u00a0 647.52 - It's not a moral failure. But it's also not your\u00a0 identity. Now, some mental illnesses are chronic,\u00a0\u00a0 653.7 - but that's just not the first assumption I would\u00a0 make about a case of depression, anxiety, or PTSD.\u00a0\u00a0 659.46 - It's also not inherent to who you are. I see it\u00a0 more as being about a lack of resources; you just\u00a0\u00a0 665.46 - don't know what skills can help you to overcome\u00a0 your challenges. I would say it's certainly not\u00a0\u00a0 669.96 - helpful to blame yourself or beat yourself up for\u00a0 the way that you're feeling. You say, \"Let's take\u00a0\u00a0 674.88 - a step back,\" and just ask, is there something\u00a0 that you can do that's going to improve your life?\u00a0\u00a0 680.76 - If your gut reaction to that question is\u00a0 like, \"I'm offended,\" then it's possible\u00a0\u00a0 685.02 - you've over-identified with your diagnosis.\u00a0 Instead, hold labels and diagnoses flexibly.\u00a0\u00a0 692.22 - Use a diagnosis when it's helpful for you, but\u00a0 don't cling to it so tightly that it limits your\u00a0\u00a0 698.52 - options. Explore multiple treatment options before\u00a0 deciding that your situation is chronic. Again,\u00a0\u00a0 704.4 - if you do have a mental-health diagnosis, please\u00a0 don't resign yourself to just coping with it or\u00a0\u00a0 708.72 - feeling miserable for the rest of your life.\u00a0 There is so much that can be done to resolve\u00a0\u00a0 714.0 - the symptoms and sometimes the cause of\u00a0 mental illness. You really can learn the\u00a0\u00a0 717.78 - skills to get better at feeling and change your\u00a0 life.

Hi I\u2019m John Green and this is Crash Course European History. 3.73 - Okay so look: It has been bleak so far. 6.65 - We\u2019ve had the Black Death, the 116 Years\u2019 War, a series of religious wars that culminated 12.599 - with a 30 Years War that killed 20% of Central Europe. 16.15 - We\u2019ve had the little ice age and witch murdering mania and the Atlantic slave trade but now, 22.19 - now we get to turn our attention to the scientific revolution, which profoundly reshaped our 27.75 - understanding of the universe and ourselves. 31.33 - At last, we are going to make real, undeniable progress. 35.52 - What\u2019s that? 36.93 - Oh, Stan tells me that many of these scientists were persecuted for sciencing. 41.67 - Great. 42.67 - But that doesn\u2019t stop humans from developing the central insight that reshapes human history. 47.34 - It\u2019s about to get really heliocentric around here... 53.09 - [Intro] Before we get into the scientific revolution, 61.18 - I just want to make one broad comment that might be obvious if you\u2019ve watched previous 65.519 - videos in this series: For most of human history, people did not expect to live healthier or 71.709 - more prosperous lives than previous generations. 75.689 - Sometimes life got better, and sometimes it got worse. 78.42 - It\u2019s true that human populations were increasing and that life expectancy was increasing gradually, 84.85 - but the idea that it is normal for human life to get better over time is very new. 90.679 - Today, most European countries have high life expectancy, low maternal mortality, and low 95.82 - rates of absolute poverty. 97.609 - But there have been about 10,000 generations of humans, and we are perhaps the 10th generation 103.47 - who could reliably expect disease burden and child mortality and poverty to steadily decrease 109.529 - in our lifetimes. 110.669 - Well, I\u2019m part of the 10th. 112.77 - You\u2019re probably part of the 11th. 114.329 - But regardless, we owe much of this change to the Scientific Revolution. 118.499 - So, like the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution was another break with religious teachings. 123.899 - The Catholic Church taught that the earth was the center of the universe and had been 128.09 - so since the Creation. 129.979 - The sun, moon, and planets traveled around the earth in perfectly circular orbits like 135.65 - the rings of an onion. 137.23 - And beyond the onion was the realm of the divine, whose light pierced through in the 142.201 - form of stars. 143.43 - All this perfect motion was the work of God Himself. 146.379 - And any other understanding of the universe was thus a challenge to God\u2019s eternal perfection 152.12 - as described in the scriptures. 154.43 - But, like good Renaissance people, the new astronomers, mathematicians, and their colleagues 159.72 - in other fields declared that old theories needed to be reexamined. 164.28 - The first problem was that the perfect orbits of the planets, and moon, and sun did not 169.319 - fit with observation, causing astronomers to resort to ancient Ptolemaic explanations 174.68 - (basically that planets followed their own circular paths, which also revolved around 179.51 - the Earth). 180.769 - Just before his death in 1543, Polish-born Nicholas Copernicus, a well-connected doctor 186.319 - of canon law and researcher in mathematics, and astronomy, and classical literature, published 191.56 - On the Revolution of the Celestial Spheres. 194.659 - He noted problems with classical astronomical theory and determined that the universe was 200.9 - \u201cheliocentric\u201d\u2014that is, the sun, rather than the earth, was at the center. 205.299 - The Catholic Church\u2019s reaction to this was negative: the Italian monk Giordano Bruno, 211.069 - for instance, was burned at the stake in 1600 for teaching Copernicus\u2019s heliocentric findings. 216.56 - But even earlier than that, in 1572, Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe spotted a new star 221.81 - and in 1577 a new comet, further confirmation that the universe was not immutably and perfectly 229.4 - created. 230.4 - Then, Johannes Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion announced early in the seventeenth 235.06 - century that the orbits of the planets were elliptical\u2014not perfectly circular. 240.44 - The solar system was a solar system, and it wasn\u2019t an onion. 245.56 - Something other than divine will was keeping the planets apart and in motion. 250.17 - Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 252.049 - By this time, the observations of Galileo Galilei were bringing matters to a head. 257.4 - Galileo was obsessed with science, especially its mathematical features and the 261.22 - calculations at the base of Copernicus\u2019s heliocentric theory. 265.47 - Galileo\u2019s father had wanted him to become a doctor but mathematics drew him in. 270.08 - It\u2019s the oldest story in the world. 271.91 - He invented many tools like an early thermometer and his own telescope, which he used to dramatically 277.02 - improve human understanding of the universe -he was the first person to observe the moons 281.24 - of Jupiter, and the first to understand that the Milky Way was a collection of stars. 285.96 - The telescope also showed irregular spots on the sun, a further sign of heavenly imperfections 291.3 - that went against the beliefs espoused by the Catholic Church. 294.96 - Despite Galileo\u2019s prestige as a mathematician, his work on the nature of the universe went 299.87 - too far for the Church. 301.21 - In 1615, Galileo went to Rome to teach the clergy about the heliocentric universe and 306.53 - convince them of its accuracy. 308.37 - In 1616, it was condemned as heretical and Galileo promised not to teach that the earth 314.05 - moved. 315.05 - But, in 1632, he published Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems in which he described 321.08 - the Ptolemaic system on which the Church based its earth-centered astronomical teachings 325.849 - and the Copernican system. 327.93 - In 1636, the Roman Inquisition found him guilty of heresy and forced him to recant in order 333.38 - to avoid execution. 335.05 - And so Galileo recanted. 336.539 - In 1992, after a 13 year investigation, the Catholic Church finally publicly acknowledged 342.5 - that the judgment against him had been wrong.\" 345.15 - Thanks Thought Bubble. 346.6 - Centuries later, Albert Einstein would write, \u201cAll knowledge of reality starts from experience 351.849 - and ends in it. 353.66 - \u2026 Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific 358.34 - world, he is the father of modern physics--indeed, of modern science altogether.\u201d 363.33 - We talk about this at length of course in our history of science series, but for our 366.82 - purposes here it\u2019s important to understand that Galileo and other scientists used experimentation 371.979 - and mathematical calculation to confirm or refute hypotheses--and that scientific method 378.71 - was genuinely revolutionary. 380.599 - The scientific approach also spread to other fields of inquiry. 384.21 - Ancient medical theories began to unravel, as English medical doctor William Harvey pronounced 388.979 - the heart to be a pump based on dissections he\u2019d performed. 392.71 - He called the heart \u201ca piece of Machinery\u201d that worked according to natural laws. 396.99 - But it\u2019s important to note that even as mechanical theories took hold, prominent \u201cnew\u201d 401.509 - scientists continued to believed in unseen forces at work in the universe. 405.72 - For example, astrology, positing that the planets and stars influenced people and events, 410.98 - sought to map those influences. 413.25 - Some scientists found it credible --and they pursued all kinds of mystical, 417.22 - and occult, and alchemical investigations. 420.099 - Any revolution needs good propagandists, and people were advertising that the \u201cnew\u201d 424.919 - scientific values and practices were amazing while also pointing out that the ancient and 429.879 - traditional ones were full of errors. 432.5 - English politician Francis Bacon was foremost among these science propagandists, chiding 437.45 - everyone who was using the old paradigms and models of the universe\u2014calling them worthless 442.53 - ancients. 443.53 - Bacon, like others at the time, created his own careful observations, and experiments, 448.099 - and sought to use reason. 449.74 - There was, he said, a scientific method to be followed. 453.03 - One needn\u2019t rely on past accounts that were copies of copies of copies--one should ask 457.849 - their own questions, and do their own experiments to find the answer to those questions, experiments 463.479 - that other people could then replicate to confirm--or refute--the findings. 468.689 - And this became the basis for the new scientific method as Bacon laid it out in The Advancement 473.25 - of Learning. 474.419 - His process of reaching the truth and drawing conclusions from specific, reliable facts 479.969 - or evidence is called inductive reasoning. 483.039 - And a collection of reliable, verified evidence was essential, according to Bacon, not \u201cold 489.169 - wives\u2019 fables\u201d or, as another new scientist put it, not \u201cmaunderings of a babbling hag\u201d\u2014words 495.979 - that were part of the discourse of witches who were being tried and murdered at the time. 500.759 - And then there was French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes who moved speculation about the 505.15 - new science to a still different methodological register by looking at the mind. 511.469 - Descartes noted that reason\u2014thinking\u2014was made for verification, so thinking on one\u2019s 516.59 - own was crucial. 518.01 - Because, otherwise there were so many facts that one could essentially become skeptical 522.56 - about whether truth actually existed. 525.73 - Like imagine a world where there are facts, but there are also \u201calternate\u201d facts, 529.88 - and you have to choose between your set of facts before you reach a conclusion. 534.2 - That would be unlivable! 535.65 - So Descartes set out to prove the one thing he felt he could be sure of. 540.11 - His own existence. 541.68 - And in doing so, he prioritized his own power of thinking: \u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d 548.42 - But he also prioritized doubt, which is central to the scientific method--Descartes also wrote, 554.57 - \u201cWe cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt.\u201d 558.4 - In short, our ability to conceive of doubt about whether we exist, is proof that we exist. 565.17 - By privileging the role that thought, and with it questioning, play in discovering truth, 570.23 - Descartes had developed deductive reasoning: that is, faith in the rational power of the 574.89 - mind to generate specific truths from its own theories or power of thinking. 579.79 - (By the way in addition to a Crash Course in the history of science, we also have a 583.48 - crash course in philosophy, where you can learn more about Descartes.) 585.62 - Okay, let\u2019s turn our attention to Isaac Newton, who synthesized new methodology and 589.66 - his own findings in his universal laws of motion. 593.3 - Newton was a scientist with a reputation for following every lead, Newton practiced alchemy\u2014that 601.44 - is the quest for secret formulae and practices, especially an entity called the philosopher\u2019s 607.54 - stone that could turn lead or other base metals into gold. 611.11 - Which by the way would be an inflationary disaster, but fortunately it\u2019s impossible. 614.9 - But I think that\u2019s important to note because it reminds us that not every lead being followed 620.97 - by scientists--then or now--results in big discoveries, but part of the glory of science 627.22 - is learning what doesn\u2019t work. 629.52 - Also, it reminds us that in the 17th century, many of the smartest people in the world believed 634.62 - in alchemy, a nice opportunity to reflect on what false promises contemporary humans 639.95 - might believe. 640.95 - At any rate, while studying alchemy, he also pulled together the findings of his predecessors 645.64 - into mathematical laws for the functioning of the universe. 649.45 - He quantified the major constructs of mass, inertia, force, velocity and acceleration 654.77 - and produced the law of gravitation. 657.0 - And he encapsulated all his findings in his Principia Mathematica in 1687. 662.06 - For Newton, the universe was indeed a fantastic, regular, and all encompassing machine, yet 667.21 - it was a machine still tinged with the mysteries that he continued to decipher, and to be fair 673.01 - that we are still deciphering today. 675.61 - By the early decades of the seventeenth century, contact with the wider world led to other 679.88 - kinds of scientific investigations. 682.36 - Adventurers brought back to Europe new species of plants, and textiles, minerals, animal 687.96 - life that sparked wonder and scientific probing. 691.01 - One of the first to venture out was Portuguese doctor Garcia da Orta. 694.63 - He traveled first to Goa, India, studying plants like aloe, cannabis, coconut, and ginger. 700.75 - In 1563, he published Conversations on the Simples, Drugs and Medicinal Substances of 706.46 - India, which advanced the use of plants as medicine. 710.18 - Local people were key to major plant discoveries: Dr. da Orta, for instance, learned from healers 715.08 - in South Asia, while in the 1620s local people in Lima cured a Jesuit priest with malaria 721.0 - by giving him the medicine they used--quina-quina. 724.13 - Eventually this healing bark was turned into quinine, a malaria medication that allowed 728.67 - Europeans to expand their empires more deeply into Africa and South America. 734.38 - In the cases of both Doctor da Orta and the Jesuits in Peru, European advances, like others 740.12 - that would follow, depended on gathering up scientific and medical knowledge from other 744.93 - people. 745.93 - Within Europe, scientific networks developed around heliocentrism and also around other 750.33 - new ideas just as they had in the Renaissance. 753.04 - Like Erasmus and his correspondents, Galileo and scientists across Europe wrote one another 758.29 - and published books about their findings. 760.85 - The Royal Society of London had its \u201crepublic of letters.\u201d 764.62 - And communication like that became pivotal both to verification and to convince as much 769.48 - of the public as possible that these new scientific discoveries were valid. 774.42 - Amid warfare, the little ice age, and famine, these scientists were corresponding about 779.36 - comets, windmills, pumps, and blood vessels. 783.02 - Theories about vision and atomism passed around in letters, reached as far as the Ottoman 787.25 - Empire and Japan. 788.75 - Governments also got in on the Scientific Revolution, giving scientists like Galileo 792.86 - stipends to support their work, and labeling them \u201cCourt Mathematicians,\u201d which added 797.47 - prestige both to the scientist and the royal court itself. 801.3 - Louis XIV of France started one of the most prestigious scientific academies\u2014the royal 805.85 - Academy of Sciences\u2014in 1666. 808.42 - And Theaters of anatomy, where dissections and other physiological demonstrations occurred, 813.57 - also received official sponsorship. 815.32 - Oh, did the globe open at last? 817.91 - Is Yorick in there? 819.03 - Alas, poor Yorick...I didn\u2019t know eyebrows were a skeletal feature. 822.72 - For the first, like, 98 percent of history, we knew so little about how all of this works. 827.04 - Look, I\u2019m never going to be a ventriloquist, OK? 828.95 - Stan, this isn\u2019t a real skull, is it? 832.71 - Ugh! 833.71 - We will examine the mounting power of the state next week beyond its sponsorship of 839.62 - science. 840.62 - For the moment, let\u2019s reflect on the ways in which so-called new scientists during the 844.69 - sixteenth and seventeenth centuries bravely took religious scriptures out of the workings 849.61 - of astronomy and the heavens. 851.55 - Instead of a divine hand at work, by the time of Newton, universal laws for the operation 856.56 - of the solar system and physical bodies had been established. 860.22 - Although most people believed in God, many of them earnestly so, they also followed a 864.82 - developing scientific method and additionally established faith in their own rational powers. 870.97 - This way of looking at the world would prove so important that less than 350 years after 876.22 - Galileo became the first person to observe the moon\u2019s cratered surface, human beings 881.53 - would step foot on that surface. 884.33 - Thanks for watching. 885.33 - I\u2019ll see you next time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 00:00 -

Data Analytics everyone's talking about it but\u00a0 what exactly is it perhaps you've heard that Data\u00a0\u00a0 7.44 - Analytics is the next big thing for business\u00a0 and want to find more about what the field\u00a0\u00a0 11.2 - involves by the end of this video you should have\u00a0 a better understanding of what data analytics is\u00a0\u00a0 15.36 - and you'll have a better understanding\u00a0 of what you'll be doing in the role 21.52 - in this video we're going to cover five key points\u00a0 to give you a better understanding of what it is\u00a0\u00a0 25.68 - to be a Data Analyst and how do you start working\u00a0 in this field as you're watching the video if\u00a0\u00a0 29.76 - you've got any questions about the topics that we\u00a0 cover just drop them in the comments below before\u00a0\u00a0 33.76 - we dive in if you're enjoying the video content\u00a0 please give us a like and subscribe to get more\u00a0\u00a0 37.76 - weekly videos like this so let's dive into step\u00a0 number one perhaps you're thinking about becoming\u00a0\u00a0 45.76 - a data analyst and want to know exactly what a\u00a0 career in the field involves most companies are\u00a0\u00a0 50.88 - collecting loads of data all the time but in its\u00a0 raw form this data doesn't actually mean anything\u00a0\u00a0 56.48 - this is where data analytics comes in data\u00a0 analytics is the process of analyzing raw data\u00a0\u00a0 61.52 - so that we can pull out insights which are useful\u00a0 to companies these insights are super important to\u00a0\u00a0 66.8 - drive smart business decisions what a data analyst\u00a0 does is they take all this complex jigsaw of data\u00a0\u00a0 72.8 - they take it out and they make it into\u00a0 something which you can really use\u00a0\u00a0 75.84 - having interpreted the data the data analyst can\u00a0 then pass these insights on so that the company\u00a0\u00a0 80.24 - can then make the most informed decisions\u00a0 so you can think of data analytics as a\u00a0\u00a0 84.24 - kind of business intelligence used to solve\u00a0 problems and challenges that every company has\u00a0\u00a0 89.04 - it's all about finding patterns in the data which\u00a0 can tell you something useful or relevant about\u00a0\u00a0 93.36 - the business operations so for instance how\u00a0 customers engage with a particular product or\u00a0\u00a0 97.84 - employees engage with a particular tool armed with\u00a0 the insights of data companies are then able to\u00a0\u00a0 102.96 - make better decisions about their audience company\u00a0 as a whole and the industry in which they work in 111.28 - Step one we looked at what Data Analytics\u00a0 actually is in step two we're going to look\u00a0\u00a0 115.44 - at how data analytics is used so what does data\u00a0 analytics actually look like in action and how is\u00a0\u00a0 120.96 - it used in the real world so the fact is data is\u00a0 everywhere so it actually has an infinite amount\u00a0\u00a0 126.32 - of uses across all kinds of businesses and\u00a0 organizations globally broadly speaking data\u00a0\u00a0 131.52 - analytics is used to make faster and better\u00a0 business decisions to reduce overall business\u00a0\u00a0 136.48 - costs and to develop new and innovative products\u00a0 and services in more specific terms data analytics\u00a0\u00a0 142.4 - might be used to do the following to predict\u00a0 future sales or purchasing behaviors for security\u00a0\u00a0 147.6 - purposes to help and protect against fraud to\u00a0 analyze the effectiveness of marketing campaigns\u00a0\u00a0 153.36 - to boost customer acquisition and retention or\u00a0 to increase supply chain efficiency so that gives\u00a0\u00a0 158.88 - you a little bit of an overview of what data\u00a0 analytics can be used for in the real world 166.48 - Step three let's dive into what a data\u00a0 analyst actually does on a day-to-day basis\u00a0\u00a0 171.12 - if you're thinking about becoming a data analyst\u00a0 you're probably interested in the roles and\u00a0\u00a0 175.04 - responsibilities that you'll have in the field\u00a0 based on some real job ads here are some typical\u00a0\u00a0 180.08 - roles and responsibilities that you'll have to\u00a0 undertake as a data analyst manage the delivery\u00a0\u00a0 184.64 - of user satisfaction surveys and report on\u00a0 results using data visualization software\u00a0\u00a0 189.44 - work with business line owners to develop\u00a0 requirements define success metrics\u00a0\u00a0 193.68 - manage and execute analytical projects and\u00a0 evaluate results monitor practices processes\u00a0\u00a0 198.88 - and systems to identify opportunities for\u00a0 improvement translate important questions\u00a0\u00a0 203.2 - into concrete analytical tasks gather new\u00a0 data to answer client questions collating\u00a0\u00a0 208.4 - and organizing data from multiple sources\u00a0 design build test and maintain back-end code\u00a0\u00a0 214.0 - establish data processes define data quality\u00a0 criteria and implement data quality processes\u00a0\u00a0 219.92 - work as part of a team to evaluate and analyze key\u00a0 data that will be used to shape future business\u00a0\u00a0 224.96 - strategies so those are just some examples of what\u00a0 a data analyst would be doing in any given role\u00a0\u00a0 230.0 - to learn more about the kinds of things that\u00a0 you'll be undertaking as a data analyst why\u00a0\u00a0 233.68 - not search on job boards like linkedin indeed\u00a0 and icrunchdata.com so that was step three\u00a0\u00a0 239.6 - it was just a broad overview of what you\u00a0 can expect to be doing as a data analyst 247.44 - So now we've looked at data analytics as a role\u00a0 we're now going to go into the process of data\u00a0\u00a0 251.52 - analysis so now we're going to outline\u00a0 the five main steps a data analyst would\u00a0\u00a0 255.36 - take when approaching a new project step one\u00a0 define the questions that you want to answer\u00a0\u00a0 260.4 - you need to answer why you're conducting this\u00a0 analysis and what questions and answers you\u00a0\u00a0 264.96 - need to find at this stage you'll take a clearly\u00a0 defined problem and then you'll make a hypothesis\u00a0\u00a0 270.16 - or research question that you can go on and\u00a0 answer you'll then need to identify what types\u00a0\u00a0 274.32 - of data you'll need but importantly where it\u00a0 will come from for instance a business problem\u00a0\u00a0 278.88 - might be that customers aren't subscribing to\u00a0 a paid membership once that free trial ends\u00a0\u00a0 284.56 - your key question can then be what kind\u00a0 of strategies can the business implement\u00a0\u00a0 288.8 - to retain their customer base step two would be\u00a0 to collect this data with a clear question in mind\u00a0\u00a0 294.24 - you're ready to start collecting that data data\u00a0 analysts will usually gather data from primary\u00a0\u00a0 299.2 - sources or internal data that the company already\u00a0 has such as CRM software or email marketing tools\u00a0\u00a0 305.04 - they may tend to secondary or external sources\u00a0 such as open data sources so this can include\u00a0\u00a0 310.96 - data from government portals tools like\u00a0 google trends but also data from international\u00a0\u00a0 315.76 - organizations like the world health organization\u00a0 so step three you need to clean scrub that data\u00a0\u00a0 321.76 - once you've got that data you need to prepare\u00a0 it and ready it for analysis your original data\u00a0\u00a0 327.12 - might include duplicates anomalies or missing data\u00a0 which could distort how the data is interpreted\u00a0\u00a0 332.4 - these all need to be removed data cleaning can be\u00a0 a manual task and it can take some time but it's\u00a0\u00a0 338.32 - crucial if you want to get the right business\u00a0 insights step four is to analyze the data now\u00a0\u00a0 343.36 - for the actual analysis how you analyze the data\u00a0 will depend on the question that you're asking\u00a0\u00a0 348.48 - and the kind of data that you're working\u00a0 with but some common techniques include\u00a0\u00a0 352.08 - regression analysis cluster analysis and time\u00a0 series analysis to name just a few we're going to\u00a0\u00a0 357.52 - go into these analysis terms much deeper in future\u00a0 videos but if you have any specific questions now\u00a0\u00a0 362.0 - drop us a comment in the comments below moving\u00a0 on to step 5 we need to interpret and share the\u00a0\u00a0 366.88 - results the final step in this process is where\u00a0 data is turned into valuable business insights\u00a0\u00a0 372.72 - depending on the type of analysis conducted you'll\u00a0 present your findings in a way that others can\u00a0\u00a0 377.28 - understand in the form of a chart or a graph for\u00a0 example at this stage you'll be able to say what\u00a0\u00a0 382.4 - the data analysis actually shows you in regards\u00a0 to your initial question or business challenge\u00a0\u00a0 387.76 - and you'll collaborate with key stakeholders\u00a0 on how to move forward this is a great moment\u00a0\u00a0 392.08 - to reflect and look at the limitations of your\u00a0 data and what further analysis might be conducted\u00a0\u00a0 400.88 - rounding off step four we're going to move\u00a0 on to the next step what skills you need\u00a0\u00a0 404.56 - to actually become a data analyst in addition to\u00a0 the role description and the processes that we've\u00a0\u00a0 408.96 - described so far data analysts are also expected\u00a0 to demonstrate certain skills and abilities\u00a0\u00a0 414.0 - here are some of the most important hard and soft\u00a0 skills that you'll need to become a data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 418.88 - you'll need to have some mathematical and\u00a0 statistical ability data analysts spend a lot\u00a0\u00a0 422.88 - of their time crunching numbers so you'll need to\u00a0 have a mathematical brain you'll have to have some\u00a0\u00a0 427.76 - working knowledge of programming languages such\u00a0 as python oracle and sql data analysts rely on\u00a0\u00a0 433.2 - a number of programming languages to carry out\u00a0 their work this may seem daunting at first but\u00a0\u00a0 437.84 - it's nothing that can't be learned over time with\u00a0 practice you'll also need an analytical mindset\u00a0\u00a0 442.64 - it's not just about crunching the numbers and\u00a0 sharing your data sometimes you'll need to dig\u00a0\u00a0 447.04 - deeper to understand really what's going on\u00a0 it's all in the name an analytical mindset is\u00a0\u00a0 451.76 - a must remember data analytics is about answering\u00a0 questions and solving business challenges and that\u00a0\u00a0 457.52 - requires some keen problem-solving skills data\u00a0 analysts have a wide variety of tools at their\u00a0\u00a0 462.96 - disposal and you'll need to know which one to use\u00a0 and when you'll also need excellent communication\u00a0\u00a0 468.24 - skills once you've harvested your data for\u00a0 valuable insights it's important to share your\u00a0\u00a0 472.8 - findings so that it benefits the business data\u00a0 analysts work in close collaboration with key\u00a0\u00a0 477.52 - business stakeholders and they may be responsible\u00a0 for sharing their insights to those stakeholders\u00a0\u00a0 482.0 - but also the entire company so if you're thinking\u00a0 about becoming a data analyst you need to be\u00a0\u00a0 486.24 - comfortable with this aspect of the job so that\u00a0 summarises some of the key hard and soft skills\u00a0\u00a0 491.2 - you'll require as a data analyst i hope this\u00a0 has been a value obviously this isn't a broad\u00a0\u00a0 495.52 -

Your world. 15.769 - In an effort to figure out: what gives it meaning, what makes it beautiful, where its 19.8 - evils come from, and ultimately, what is the very nature of reality itself. 24.42 - And along the way, we\u2019re going to question every aspect of your own personal life -- why 28.64 - you do what you do, why you think what you think, why you feel what you feel. 33.199 - Now, if you\u2019ve joined me on Crash Course before, you might say, we\u2019ve learned about 36.499 - all that stuff before -- in psychology, and biology, and anatomy and physiology. 40.229 - And it\u2019s true: Science can definitely help us understand our thoughts, feelings, and actions. 44.5 - But on this particular journey, we\u2019re going to be exploring aspects of the human condition that can\u2019t 48.86 - be explained only by hormones or neurotransmitters, by personal experiences or hereditary conditions. 54.959 - Because, all of those chemicals and experiences that make us who we are, can actually raise 58.489 - as many questions as they answer. 60.35 - Like, if all of my decisions really are just the result of, say, how I was raised, and 64.17 - what chemicals I have flowing in my brain, then are any of my choices actually free? 68.83 - And if I\u2019m not truly free to make my own decisions, or choose my own actions, then 73.299 - how can I be held accountable for them? 75.09 - Yeah. It\u2019s going to be that kind of journey. 76.869 - Rather than just looking at the world and describing what we see, we\u2019ll be evaluating it. 80.669 - We will take nothing as a given, set our assumptions aside -- or at least, try really hard to -- and 85.34 - do our best to see the world as if we\u2019ve never seen it before. 88.079 - And for what it\u2019s worth, we\u2019ll also be talking about Batman, and what Dick Grayson 91.52 - can teach us about the concept of identity. 93.42 - And we\u2019ll learn how The Matrix can you help understand the life and writing of Rene Descartes. 97.22 - Also we\u2019ll try to answer unanswerable questions, and puzzle over paradoxes that have plagued 102.009 - geniuses for thousands of years. 103.78 - It\u2019s going to be hard, and enlightening, and frustrating, and if I do my job properly, 107.909 - it\u2019ll stick with you long after you and I have parted ways. Because: 111.429 - We are going to do\u2026philosophy! 113.609 - [Theme Music] 123.9 - These days, people use the word \u201cphilosophy\u201d to describe some opinion they might have, 127.619 - or the approach they take to a certain topic. 129.6 - Like, you might have a \u201cphilosophy\u201d when it comes to golf. Though...I personally do not. 133.86 - But we\u2019re going to use this word more narrowly, to describe a way of approaching the world 137.569 - that traces its roots back to ancient Greece, 500 years before the Common Era. 141.709 - This was a time of great intellectual movement around the world. Buddhism and Jainism were 145.65 - developing in Asia, at the same time philosophical thought was emerging in Greece. 149.629 - There, scholars were tangled up in a distinction they were just beginning to make -- between 153.25 - philos and mythos \u2013 or what we\u2019d now roughly call science and storytelling. 157.4 - At that time, there were bards, like Homer, who were trying to understand and explain 161.239 - the world through stories, while the earliest philosophers were using methods that were 164.62 - more analytical and scientific -- although they didn\u2019t really have the concept of \u201cscience\u201d back then. 169.1 - So philosophia \u2013 literally \"the love of wisdom\" \u2013 was a new way of trying to make sense of the world. 174.629 - When the earliest philosophers used the word \u201cphilosophy,\u201d they basically meant, \u201cthe 178.469 - academic study of anything.\u201d 179.97 - Which, like, I guess could include golf. 182.099 - But at what we might call the first universities in the western world \u2013 Plato\u2019s Academy, 186.15 - and its rival, Aristotle\u2019s Lyceum \u2014 math, biology, physics, poetry, political science, 190.769 - and astronomy were all considered to be philosophy. 193.429 - Eventually, scholars began thinking of these fields differently -- as separate disciplines. 197.43 - Studies that had strong empirical elements came to be considered science -- a search for answers. 201.84 - But philosophy came to be understood more as a way of thinking about questions. Big questions. 207.24 - And today, twenty-five hundred years after the ancient Greeks first brought them up, 210.54 - philosophers still love asking questions -- oftentimes, the same questions -- 214.92 - and they don\u2019t mind that they never get an answer. 217.68 - So. What are these big questions that have managed to intrigue -- and stump -- philosophers for so long? 223.049 - One of the first might best be phrased as: What is the world like? 226.629 - Sounds simple enough to answer, right Like, just look around! See all the stuff? 230.149 - Well, this is what the world is like. 231.81 - But the philosophical approach isn\u2019t just based on observation -- it has other, much 235.45 - more complex questions packed inside it. 237.92 - When a philosopher wonders what the world is like, she might really be asking: What\u2019s the nature of reality? 243.079 - Like, is the world just made up of matter and energy, or is there something else going on? 247.18 - And if it is just matter and energy, then where did it all come from? Is there a God? 250.54 - And if so, what is he, she, or it like? 253.409 - And for that matter, when you\u2019re asking about the world, can you also be asking about 256.94 - the nature of yourself, as a citizen of the world. 260.1 - So\u2026what kind of being am I? 262.03 - Do I have a soul? Is there something immaterial about me that will survive after I die? 266.35 - All of these questions are ways of exploring what philosophers call metaphysics -- one 270.26 - of the three main branches of philosophy -- an effort to understand the fundamental nature 275.08 - of the world, of the universe, and of being. 277.66 - Now, if those questions aren\u2019t heady enough for you, we, as students of philosophy, also 282.2 - have a whole separate set of questions, that are about how we know the answers to any of this stuff. 287.82 - This particular strain of philosophy, which is like knowing about knowing, is epistemology 293.11 - -- literally the study of knowledge -- the second major field of philosophy. 296.77 - And it poses questions like: Is the world really what I think it is? 300.82 - Like, really, is everything I see and think and experience\u2026is it actually\u2026true? 305.6 - If it isn\u2019t, then, what is true? And what\u2019s the best way to go about figuring out the truth? Is science the best way? 311.1 - Or are there more ethereal paths to Truth, paths that science can never really travel? 315.65 - And let\u2019s say that, after a lot of searching and question-asking, I begin to develop some 319.69 - ideas -- an inkling about what might be true. 322.41 - Then\u2026how do I know if I\u2019m right? How will I ever know I\u2019m wrong? 326.87 - Can I ever be certain about anything?! 329.09 - Now, at this point I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you\u2019re thinking: \u201cAm I real?\u201d \u201cDo 332.98 - I...do I know anything?\u201d Well, as questions go, these might not seem super\u2026practical. 338.06 - But there\u2019s another area of philosophy that helps frame your thinking around what you 341.69 - actually do -- like, how you should act, and what you should attach meaning to. 346.08 - It\u2019s called Value Theory. And it\u2019s usually divided into two main branches. The first is Ethics. 350.62 - You\u2019ve heard of it -- it\u2019s the thing that politicians are always said to lack? And Jedi 354.34 - are supposed to have in great supply? Though, don\u2019t get me started on the prequels. 357.79 - In philosophy, though, ethics isn\u2019t just a code of what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. 361.36 - It\u2019s the study of how humans should live with each other. 364.03 - Rather than just sitting around and judging people, ethics involves posing questions like: How should I live? 368.72 - Is there any reason that I should treat, say, strangers differently than the people I love? 373.17 - And for that matter, do I owe anything to myself? What about animals? Or the earth? 377.75 - And if I do have any of these obligations at all, where do they come from? Who says? 381.83 - Ultimately, whatever system you use to decide what\u2019s good or evil, as human behavior goes, 386.61 - is determined by your values -- that\u2019s why ethics is considered part of Value Theory. 390.8 - But the other part of value theory isn\u2019t about what\u2019s right -- it\u2019s about what\u2019s beautiful. 395.14 - Aesthetics is the study of beauty, and art. 397.36 - Now, the concept of beauty is talked about practically everywhere, from the media, to art school to barber college. 402.74 - But for philosophers, the pursuit of aesthetics involves considering what beauty is, and whether it even exists. 408.6 - Aesthetics is a part of value theory, because beauty, and art, are things we value, and 413.25 - evaluate. And many people who study this particular kind of philosophy -- known as aestheticians 417.99 - -- believe there is such as thing as The Beautiful -- something that doesn\u2019t depend on what 423.02 - you happen to find attractive, but something that\u2019s just objectively true. 426.92 - And finally, there\u2019s one more aspect of philosophy that I should mention, because 429.71 - it doesn\u2019t ask questions, so much as help us find answers. Yes, finally, some answers! 434.37 - And that thing, which I happen to think can be beautiful in its own way, is logic. 438.4 - Logic is the philosopher\u2019s toolbox. It contains the saws and hammers, the microscopes and 443.62 - beakers, that philosophers use to go about answering their questions in a clear, systematic way. 448.99 - Logic is about reasoning, giving strong arguments that don\u2019t fall victim to fallacies, which 453.98 - are, as you\u2019ll learn, the mortal enemies of philosophical precision. 457.66 - Ok, so metaphysics, epistemology, value theory -- they might all seem pretty airy and abstract. 463.53 - But don\u2019t worry, because you have already done philosophy, even though you might not realize it. 467.4 - You do it in almost every aspect of your life. 469.77 - Every time you argue with your parents, or wonder if you should date someone, or decide 473.74 - to eat a salad instead of a ham \u2018n\u2019 cheese Hot Pocket, you are doing philosophy. 477.77 - Because you\u2019re thinking about the world, and your place in it. You\u2019re figuring out 481.46 - what you value, why you value it, and what you should do about it. 484.84 - So here\u2019s our plan. We\u2019re going to learn about the major fields of philosophy, posing 488.31 - questions and considering possible answers along the way. And each time, we will use a two-step method. 494.12 - First, we\u2019ll really try to understand. 495.95 - You\u2019re not going to agree with all of the ideas that I present to you \u2013 and I won\u2019t 499.9 - agree with them either! That\u2019s not the point. The point, in step one, is to really try to 504.37 - get inside of an idea \u2013 to understand it as charitably as possible. 508.39 - Then, in step two, you\u2019ll subject your understanding to some serious critical evaluation \u2013 basically, 514.0 - you\u2019ll try to knock down what you think you know about a particular view of the world. 518.68 - And you\u2019ll do this whether you agree with the view or not. 521.48 - Why? Because: Only when you challenge your understanding of how some people view the 525.99 - world, can you decide for yourself if theirs is a view worth having. 529.43 - Which leads me to my final point: Philosophy is not your usual field of study. 533.339 - I\u2019m not going to be teaching you a body of knowledge where success means you know a bunch of stuff. 537.54 - Success, in this course, will mean that you know how to think. 540.5 - All we have are questions. And all you have is a brain. And the goal of philosophy is 545.269 - for you to use your brain to come up with the answers that make the most sense to you. 548.759 - You\u2019ll learn how to formulate arguments to support your ideas, so you can explain why you think you\u2019re right. 553.42 - Which, if you\u2019ve ever been on the Internet, you know is something that not a lot of people are good at. 557.18 - In order to do that, you\u2019re going to need to understand philosophical reasoning \u2013 the 560.399 - tools we use to investigate life\u2019s most perplexing questions! And that is where we\u2019re 565.259 - gonna be headed the next time we meet. 566.889 - For now you\u2019ve learned about the historical origins of philosophy in ancient Greece, and 570.449 - its three main divisions: metaphysics, epistemology, and value theory. We also talked about logic, 575.72 - and how you\u2019re going to use it to understand and critically evaluate a whole host of different worldviews. 581.339 - But not about golf. 583.54 - This episode of Crash Course Philosophy is made possible by Squarespace.

It\u2019s a state park now? The government owns it? Well, there you go. 139.88 - Now, railroads didn\u2019t create the desire to settle the west but they did make it possible for people who wanted to live out west to do so, for two reasons. 146.88 - First, without railroads there would be no way to bring crops or other goods to market. 151.48 - I mean, I guess you could dig a canal across Kansas, but, if you\u2019ve ever been to Kansas that is not a tantalizing proposition. 156.74 - Second, railroads made life in the west profitable and livable because they brought the goods that people needed, 162.02 - such as tools for planting and sowing, shoes for wearing, books for putting on your shelf and pretending to have read. 168.54 - Railroads allowed settlers to stay connected with the modernity that was becoming the hallmark of the industrialized world in the 19th century. 174.36 - Now, we saw last week that the Federal government played a key role in financing the transcontinental railroad, but state governments got into the act too, often to their financial detriment. 182.26 - In fact, so many states nearly went bankrupt financing railroads that most states now have constitutional requirements that they balance their budgets. 188.96 - But perhaps the central way that the Federal government supported the railroads, and western settlement and investment in general, 194.54 - was by leading military expeditions against American Indians, rounding them up on ever-smaller reservations, and destroying their culture. 201.76 - Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 203.04 - There was an economic as well as a racial imperative to move the Native Americans off their land: white people wanted it. 209.18 - Initially it was needed to set down railroad tracks, and then for farming. 212.34 - But eventually it was also exploited for minerals like gold and iron and other stuff that makes industry work. 217.66 - I mean, would you really want a territory called the Badlands unless it had valuable minerals? 222.44 - Early western settlement, of the Oregon Trail kind, did not result in huge conflicts with Native Americans, 226.92 - but by the 1850s, a steady stream of settlers kicked off increasingly bloody conflicts that lasted pretty much until 1890. 233.6 - Even though the fighting started before the Civil War, the end of the \u201cwar between the states\u201d 237.56 - meant a new, more violent phase in the warring between American Indians and whites. 241.86 - General Philip H. \u201cLittle Phil\u201d Sheridan set out to destroy the Indians\u2019 way of life, 246.06 - burning villages and killing their horses and especially the buffalo that was the basis of the plains tribes\u2019 existence. 251.48 - There were about 30 million buffalo in the  U.S. in 1800; by 1886 the Smithsonian Institute had difficulty finding 25 \u201cgood specimens.\u201d 259.76 - In addition to violent resistance, some Indians turned to a spiritual movement to try to preserve their traditional way of life. 265.22 - Around 1890 the Ghost Dance movement arose in and around South Dakota. 269.38 - Ghost Dancers believed that if they gathered together to dance and engage in religious rituals, 273.62 - eventually the white man would disappear and the buffalo would return, and with them the Indians\u2019 traditional customs. 279.56 - But even though a combined force of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors completely destroyed George Custer\u2019s force of 250 cavalrymen at Little Bighorn in 1876, 287.82 - and Geronimo took years to subdue in the Southwest, western Native Americans were all defeated by 1890, and the majority were moved to reservations. 295.6 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. Boy, this Wild West episode sure is turning out to be loads of fun! 299.76 - It\u2019s just like the Will Smith movie! 301.28 - All right, Stan, this is about to get even more depressing, so let\u2019s look at, like, some pretty mountains and western landscapes and stuff, while I deliver this next bit. 308.26 - So in 1871 the U.S. government ended the treaty system that had since the American Revolution treated Native American land as if they were nations. 316.52 - And then with the Dawes Act of 1887, the lands set aside for the Indians were allotted to individual families rather than to tribes. 324.0 - Indians who \u201cadopted the habits of civilized life,\u201d 327.2 - which in this case meant becoming small scale individualistic Jeffersonian farmers, 331.62 - would be granted citizenship and there were supposed to be some protections  to prevent their land from falling out of Native American possession. 337.78 - But, these protections were not particularly protective and much of the Indian land was purchased either by white settlers or by speculators. 343.72 - After the passage of the Dawes Act \u201cIndians lost 86 million of the 138 million acres of land in their possession.\u201d 350.12 - Oh boy, it\u2019s time for the Mystery Document. The rules here are simple. 354.64 - I guess the author of the Mystery Document. And then you get to see me get shocked when  I\u2019m wrong. All right. 360.08 - I have seen the Great Father Chief the Next Great Chief the Commissioner Chief; the Law Chief; 365.56 - and many other law chiefs and they all say they are my friends, and that I shall have justice, 371.22 - but while all their mouths talk right I do not understand why nothing is done for my people. 376.74 - I have heard talk and talk but nothing is done Words do not pay for my dead people. 382.56 - They do not pay for my country now overrun by white men. 386.04 - They do not protect my father's grave. 388.48 - Good words will not give my people a home where they can live in peace and take care of themselves. 393.7 - I am tired of talk that comes to nothing. 396.22 - It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and all the broken promises. 401.1 - I mean that could be almost any American Indian leader. 403.63 - This is totally unfair, Stan. All I really know about this is that the Great Father Chief is the President. 407.46 - I mean it could be any of a dozen people. 409.04 - How bout if I say the name in 10 seconds I don\u2019t get punished? 411.58 - Aaaand start. Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo, Chief Big Foot, um, Keokuk, Chief Oshkosh, 418.54 - Chief Joseph Ch-OH YES YES! 421.4 - And now let us move from tragedy to tragedy. 424.36 - So if you\u2019re thinking that it couldn\u2019t get worse for the Native Americans: it did. 428.26 - After killing off the buffalo, taking their land and forcing Indians onto reservations, 432.8 - the Bureau of Indian Affairs instituted a policy that amounted to cultural genocide. 437.36 - It set up boarding schools, the most famous of which was in Carlisle, PA, where Indian children were forcefully removed from their families to be civilized. 445.42 - This meant teaching them English, taking away their clothes, their names, and their family connections. 450.42 - The idea put succinctly, was to \u201ckill the Indian, save the man.\u201d 454.6 - Now, the U.S. wasn\u2019t the only nation busy subjugating its indigenous inhabitants and putting them on reservations in the late 19th century. 460.16 - Like, something similar was happening in South Africa, in Chile, and even to First Peoples in Canada. 465.34 - And you\u2019re usually so good, Canada. 466.98 - Although the slower pace of western settlement meant  that there was much less bloodshed, so, another point to Canada. 472.28 - And as bad as the American boarding school policy was, 475.08 - at least it was short lived compared with Australia\u2019s policy of removing Aboriginal children from families and placing them with  white foster families, which lasted until the 1970s. 483.88 - All right, Stan, we need to cheer this episode up. Let\u2019s talk about cowboys! 487.2 - The Marlboro Man riding the range, herding cows and smoking, solitary in the saddle, alone in his emphysema. 494.36 - Surely that is the actual West, the men and women but mostly men who stood apart from the industrializing country as the last of Jefferson\u2019s rugged individuals. 503.6 - But, no. Once again, we have the railroad to thank for our image of the cowboy. 508.4 - Like, those massive cattle drives of millions of cows across open range Texas? 513.02 - Yeah, they ended at towns like Abilene, and Wichita, and Dodge City \u2013 because that\u2019s where the railheads were. 518.74 - Without railroads, cowboys would have just driven their cattle in endless circles. 522.52 - And without industrial meat processing, there wouldn\u2019t have been a market for all that beef. 527.04 - And it was a lot of beef. You know what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m actually talking about beef. 531.68 - By the mid 1880s the days of open range ranching were coming to an end, 535.84 - as ranchers began to enclose more and more land and set up their businesses closer to, you guessed it, railroad stations. 541.87 - There are also quite a few things about western farming that just fly in the face of the mythical Jeffersonian yeoman farmer ideal. 548.56 - Firstly, this type of agricultural work was a family affair; 552.38 - many women bore huge burdens on western farms, as can be seen in this excerpt from a farm woman in Arizona: 558.32 - \u201cGet up, turn out my chickens, draw a pail of water \u2026 560.76 - make a fire, put potatoes to cook, brush and sweep half inch of dust off floor, 565.12 - feed three litters of chickens, then mix biscuits, get breakfast, milk, besides work in the house and this morning had to go half mile after calves.\u201d 573.56 - These family-run farms were increasingly oriented towards production of wheat and corn for national and even international markets rather than trying to eke out subsistence. 582.34 - Farmers in Kansas found themselves competing with farmers in Australia and Argentina, 587.16 - and this international competition pushed prices lower and lower. 590.7 - Secondly, the Great Plains, while remarkably productive agriculturally, wouldn\u2019t be nearly as good for producing crops without massive irrigation projects. 598.14 - Much of the water needed for plains agriculture comes a massive underground lake, the Oglala Aquifer. 603.08 - Don\u2019t worry, by the way, the Aquifer is fed by a magic and permanent H20 factory in the core of the earth that you can learn about in Hank\u2019s show, Crash Course Chemis\u2013 610.52 - What\u2019s that? It\u2019s going dry. MY GOD THIS IS A DEPRESSING EPISODE. 614.14 - Anyway, large-scale irrigation projects necessitate big capital investments, 618.16 - and therefore large, consolidated agricultural enterprises that start to look more like agri-business than family farms. 625.26 - I mean, by 1900, California was home to giant commercial farms reliant on irrigation and chemical fertilizers. 631.52 - Some of them were owned, not by families, but by big corporations like the Southern Pacific Railroad. 636.06 - And they were worked by migrant farm laborers from China, the Philippines, Japan, Mexico. 641.14 - As Henry George, a critic of late 19th century corporate capitalism, wrote 644.68 - \u201cCalifornia is not a country of farms, but \u2026 of plantations and estates.\u201d 648.7 - When studying American history, it\u2019s really easy to get caught up in the excitement of industrial capitalism with its robber barons, 655.0 - and new technologies, and fancy cities because that world looks very familiar to us, probably because it\u2019s the one in which we live. 661.68 - After all, if I was running a farm like that Arizona woman I talked about earlier, there\u2019s no way I could be making these videos because I\u2019d be chasing my calves. 668.26 - I don\u2019t even know what a litter of chickens is. 670.08 - Is it 4 chickens? 12? 6? It\u2019s probably 12 because eggs do come in dozens. 673.86 - The massive agricultural surplus contemporary farms create, 677.18 - and the efficient transportation network that gets that surplus to me quickly, makes everything else possible \u2013 from YouTube to Chevy Volts. 685.16 - And no matter who you are, you benefit from the products that result from that massive surplus. 689.44 - That\u2019s why we\u2019re watching YouTube right now. 691.44 - So, agriculture and animal husbandry did change a lot in late 19th century America, 695.44 - as we came to embrace the market driven ethos that we either celebrate or decry these days. 700.84 - And in the end, the Wild West ends up looking a lot more like industrial capitalism than like a Larry McMurtry novel. 706.68 - The Wild West, like the rest of the industrialized world, was incentivized to increase productivity and was shaped by an increasingly international economic system. 714.6 - And it\u2019s worth remembering that even though we think of the Oregon Trail and the Wild West being part of the same thing. 719.56 - In fact, they were separated by the most important event in American history: the Civil War. 723.62 - I know that ain\u2019t the mythologizing you\u2019ll  find in Tombstone, but it is true. 727.36 - Thanks for watching. I\u2019ll see you next week. 729.47 - Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko. 733.6 - The associate producer of the show is Danica Johnson. 735.98 - The show is written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Halse Rojas, and myself. 740.12 - And our graphics team is Thought Caf\u00e9. 741.98 - Every week, there\u2019s a new caption for the libertage. 743.66 - If you\u2019d like to suggest one you can do so in comments where you can also ask questions about today\u2019s video that will be answered by our team of historians. 749.34 - Thanks for watching Crash Course. If you enjoy it, make sure you subscribe. 752.36 - And as we say in my hometown, don\u2019t forget to be awesome. 754.6 - OH, ahh I didn\u2019t get a good push."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 00:00 - Introduction to the Wild West 00:21 - The Myth vs. Reality of the West 01:09 - Government Role in Settling the West 02:26 - The Role of Railroads 03:15 - Conflicts with Native Americans 04:38 - The Ghost Dance Movement and Reservation System 05:50 - The Dawes Act and Loss of Native Lands 07:00 - Cowboys and the Cattle Industry 08:29 - The Reality of Western Farming 10:01 - Agricultural Surplus and Industrial Capitalism 11:29 - The Wild West and the Civil War's Impact 12:07 - Closing Remarks and Credits"}]}

43.659 - Because if I show you the website 45.493 - where all these courses are listed. 47.44 - So you will see that 48.442 - the IIM Bangalore logo is on top of all of them. 50.746 - But not all these courses are offered by IIM Bangalore. 54.052 - For example, there is a course called 55.226 - 'Advanced Product Quality Planning'. 57.159 - On it, above the logo, it says 'Quality Council of India'. 60.794 - This means that even though 62.224 - IIM Bangalore is the national coordinator, 64.224 - this course is presented by the Quality Council of India  67.509 - or the people working there. 70.124 - Now, if you check the courses in this list, 72.47 - most of them are starting from the 15th of July. 75.847 - And if you check their registration dates, 77.882 - they are ending on different dates, 79.726 - but most of the registrations will close on 31st August. 83.502 - To apply for these courses, you don't have to pay any fee. 86.802 - They are 100% free when it comes to 89.221 - going through the material itself. 91.012 - However, if you want a certificate, 93.33 - you need to take an exam for it. 95.371 - And that exam is a paid exam. 97.699 - Now, what is the fee for that exam? 99.203 - For the general category, it is 750 rupees per exam, 101.744 - and for SC, ST, OBC, or PWD categories, 104.95 - it is 500 rupees per exam. 107.247 - Now let's address some questions that might be coming 110.749 - to your mind related to these courses or the exam. 113.827 - The first question is: who can pursue these courses? 117.02 - Any person from any age group, 119.281 - belonging to any category, 121.46 - with any educational background, 123.394 - from any state or anywhere can pursue them freely. 126.992 - If you are in India, you can also take the exam. 129.796 - If you are outside India, 131.512 - you won't be able to take the exam 133.182 - because the exam centers are only in India. 135.241 - The second question is: 136.236 - How many courses can you pursue at a time? 139.507 - Well, you can apply for as many courses as you like. 142.448 - But if you need to take their exams, 144.696 - you cannot take exams for more than 8 courses at a time. 148.506 - What is the reason for this? 149.716 - These exams are conducted in 2 slots over 4 days. 153.002 - This means that 4 specific dates will be chosen. 155.328 - And on each date, 156.365 - there will be a morning slot and an afternoon slot. 158.68 - So, in total, you can only take 8 exams. 162.162 - And that too only if those 8 courses 165.407 - are scheduled on 4 different dates. 167.874 - Next question: How do you register for these courses? 170.324 - You will see a \"Join\" button on the page of any course. 174.032 - From there, you can simply enroll by filling up your details. 177.766 - The next question is: Will the material be recorded or live? 181.811 - So every week, you will receive an email 184.046 - that new material has been added. 185.835 - New material will be uploaded on a weekly basis 188.564 - which will include videos, transcripts, 190.772 - and any documents they want to share with you. 194.246 - But all of these are already recorded. 196.281 - Nothing is live; you can access it freely at any time, 200.354 - but it will be updated weekly. 201.841 - When you receive weekly videos, 204.07 - you will also receive weekly assessments. 206.769 - The marks of these weekly assessments are important 209.693 - because they will count towards your final marks 212.184 - on which basis you will receive the certificate. 214.312 - One more thing to keep in mind is that the deadlines for 216.814 - these assignments or assessments are also important. 219.569 - If you don't complete them before the deadline, 222.592 - your marks will not be considered. 225.0 - The next question is: How do you register for the exam? 227.892 - When the course is complete, 229.719 - details about exams will be uploaded on the same page 233.458 - which is their homepage on Swayam. 235.319 - You will receive notifications about this in your email 238.469 - whenever the exam is announced. 239.9 - So don't worry about this. 241.221 - If you want to know tentative dates,  243.446 - the courses visible have some dates mentioned. 246.99 - It is 7th & 8th of December and 14th & 15th of December. 251.924 - Now comes the question of where will this exam be conducted? 255.257 - So the exam will be conducted 256.979 - at their centers in offline mode. 259.104 - Now, what is the list of those centers? 260.969 - When you register for the exam, it will appear there. 264.283 - But for reference based on last year, 266.483 - let me show you the list. 267.939 - Now, to obtain this certificate,  269.766 - what is the marking scheme that I was explaining earlier? 272.828 - You will either have weekly assessments 275.538 - or there will be a mid-term exam. 277.458 - And when it ends, there will be a final exam. 280.122 - The weightage for both is 25% and 75%. 284.322 - Now, to be eligible for the certificate, 286.964 - Your assessments, meaning your mid-term exam or 290.0 - weekly assessments, you need at least 40% marks. 292.879 - And you also need at least 40% marks in your final exam. 296.404 - Now, let me give you a list of some best courses. 299.254 - But before I share the names of those courses, 301.947 - let me also suggest you a very useful free tool that 305.429 - you can learn the practical application of these courses. 308.648 - If you look closely at these courses, 310.491 - many of them deal with management, data, and projects. 315.289 - To learn all these skills, 317.25 - you can use the Odoo's Project Management app. 320.833 - This first app is free forever 323.019 - with unlimited hosting and support. 324.931 - For example, I created a project for CAT aspirants 327.596 - called the CAT timetable. 329.765 - In this, I added different chapters in task form 333.175 - and then I created stages. 334.71 - So, if you want, you can move any task, 337.029 - meaning chapter, into different stages. 339.398 - You can change their status 340.855 - to record the progress of your project. 342.689 - You can also easily view it in this 'Kanban' view 345.663 - or you can use list view, chart view, table view, all of these. 349.418 - Within each task, you can also record the time spent 352.531 - through timesheets as well. 353.976 - Basically, this tool can help you visualize your project 357.135 - and manage your time more effectively 359.348 - while completing the tasks. 360.91 - So, I'll add the link to the CAT timetable and 362.928 - Odoo's Project Management app 365.118 - in the description and pinned comment. 367.212 - In case you would like to check them out. 368.85 - Now let's talk about those top courses 371.257 - that will add the most value to your resume. 374.47 - Now let me show you a sample certificate first 377.414 - to explain why it is important 379.144 - to choose these courses. 380.558 - So the first thing you should notice is that 383.075 - this certificate mentions name of your institute 386.727 - where professors or authorities must have taught you. 389.691 - That's why the courses I have picked 392.153 - are offered by top IIMs. 394.186 - Out of these, 9 courses are offered by IIM Bangalore  397.156 - and one course is offered by IIM Ahmedabad. 399.433 - I'm sharing the names of these courses one by one 402.35 - and showing their photographs on the screen 405.611 - so that you know which course to select. 408.82 - The 1st course is \"Banking and Financial Markets.\" 412.681 - 2.

Hi guys and welcome back to the channel. 2.147 - As I asked in the last video, 4.183 - if you want to know about finance courses other 7.079 - than the top 5, and many of you commented that 10.378 - this is the video you would like to watch. 12.526 - So here we are with the top 5 finance courses 15.441 - as well as skills that you should learn in 2024. 18.356 - In this video, I not only want to share the names and 21.024 - details of those 5 courses but, in fact, 23.264 - I want to make you capable enough so that  25.24 - if you want to go into any field tomorrow and want to 27.926 - learn its skills, you can find them on which website. 31.536 - But we'll talk about that towards the end of the video. 33.993 - Let's start with our first course, 36.286 - which will teach you the skill of financial modeling. 38.936 - It is the most important skill in the field of finance. 42.78 - There are many big institutes that offer 45.261 - quite expensive courses for it. 47.115 - For example, the Corporate Finance Institute or 49.509 - the Financial Modeling Institute, 51.602 - their courses are quite expensive. 54.272 - If you want to learn financial modeling at a basic level, 57.461 - just want to see the basics, then 59.362 - there are two free courses that I would recommend. 61.592 - The first course is available on the Udemy website, 64.507 - you can note down its name, 66.087 - or you will also find the link in the description. 68.509 - This course is a one-hour course. 70.399 - The 2nd course is available on eTrainerBox website,  73.803 - It's also a free course.  75.146 - This one is a 6-hour course. 76.99 - In both cases, you just need to sign up, and then 80.195 - you will have access to the entire course content. 82.695 - After this point, if you want to learn 85.174 - more about financial modeling, 87.1 - I would recommend a website to you that was 89.009 - recommended by a batchmate from IIM Ahmedabad. 91.579 - And he was a master in finance. 94.017 - So, the name of this website is A Simple Model. 96.566 - When you go to the homepage of this website, 98.712 - you will see an option on the left-hand side for 101.082 - Financial Analyst Fundamentals. 103.387 - Click on it, and then scroll down a bit. 106.783 - Here, you will find many lessons, 108.822 - let me take example of first lesson: \"Excel for Models.\"  111.966 - If you open it; you will see, you can watch videos in it.  116.213 - The top 4 sessions under this are freely accessible, 120.99 - and the subsequent sessions are locked. 123.515 - But if you come back to the lesson plan, 127.765 - you can see that for each lesson, 130.553 - the top 4 videos are available within it. 132.6 - And for many lessons, there are 5 videos, 135.481 - with the fifth one being a quiz. 137.381 - This means that you can learn financial modeling by 140.467 - freely accessing many resources on this website. 143.665 - It will give you a very good idea. 145.831 - This is one of the best resources. 147.776 - If you feel that you want to learn more, then 150.892 - you can take their subscription for $10 per month. 153.912 - That is completely optional, but 155.748 - I would recommend that even without it, 158.531 - you will learn a lot about financial modeling. 161.16 - Another skill, which is a very important skill in the field 164.074 - of finance, is called valuation and corporate finance. 167.547 - If you ask anyone in the entire industry 170.306 - where to learn this skill, 172.7 - everyone will recommend you the same source, 174.92 - which is Professor Aswath Damodaran. 177.007 - Professor Aswath Damodaran teaches at NYU, 179.801 - and he has many resources available. 182.275 - For example, they have their own website, 184.165 - and they also have books. 185.558 - But I would recommend a very simple resource to  188.69 - learn this skill, which is their YouTube videos. 191.174 - Just a few days ago, I was talking to one of my  193.961 - batchmates who, despite graduating from IIM, 197.461 - was watching this video series because 199.564 - he wanted to understand the concept of valuation. 201.747 - This shows how famous their videos are, 205.128 - and people still use them. 207.196 - So basically, when Professor teaches classes at NYU, 210.202 - whether it's on valuation or corporate finance, 212.591 - those classes are recorded, 214.497 - and then they are regularly added to playlists. 217.982 - The good news is that he has just started corporate 220.724 - finance and valuation classes at the end of January.  224.473 - I will add the link to these videos in the description. 228.433 - As soon as you click on it, the entire playlist will open, 231.348 - and you can access them one by one. 233.78 - If you don't want to follow along with his NYU classes 238.261 - and want to cover everything before them, 240.624 - you can watch previous playlists from 2023 or 2022. 244.458 - The third skill is financial statements and accounting.  247.812 - So, in the field of finance, 249.428 - you don't need to be able to create a balance sheet, 251.715 - profit and loss statement, and cash flow statement. 254.537 - If you know how to read and analyze these financial 257.781 - statements, meaning read and analyze 260.587 - you will be eligible for many roles. 263.447 - When we are taught concepts of accounting or 265.704 - financial management in IIMs, 268.033 - no one tells us how to create financial statements 270.592 - from a base level. 272.208 - Instead, our major role is to be able to make decisions 275.789 - by looking at those financial statements, analyze 279.242 - them, and make important decisions for the company. 282.46 - So, to learn this skill, which resource can help you? 286.161 - First, you can check out PwC's PDF titled 290.078 - \"Basic Understanding of Companies Financial Statement.\" 293.523 - This PDF is only 35 pages, simple & visually oriented. 298.788 - To be honest, when I found this resource, I was like 301.282 - if any person reads these 35 pages properly, 304.738 - they will get to know how financial statements 306.83 - look and how to read them. 309.618 - But I also understand that many of you may come 312.427 - from a non-finance background, and you might 315.305 - not have any knowledge about financial statements. 317.76 - I'll recommend a resource where they will explain to 321.478 - you visually how to read financial statements. 325.895 - This is a free course offered by CFI, which is 329.19 - the Corporate Finance Institute. 331.048 - It's a free as well as an introductory course titled  334.603 - \"Reading Financial Statements.\" 336.524 - To be honest, on Corporate Finance Institute website,  339.277 - you can find many free courses, and 340.847 - among them, this is one of the best. 342.559 - When you play the videos of this course, 344.45 - they will actually explain and demonstrate to you 347.275 - how to read a financial statement. 349.806 - Let's move on to our 4th skill, which many people are 353.215 - interested in, and that is trading and stock markets. 355.979 - For this, I gathered feedback from many websites, 359.017 - checked numerous Reddit forums, and found a 361.725 - resource that was recommended by many people. 364.436 - It is a popular resource called Zerodha Varsity. 367.642 - This is a mind-blowing course that should be a 370.737 - starting point for anyone who wants to get into 373.213 - trading or even understand financial markets. 377.331 - This is a completely free resource, openly accessible, 381.148 - meaning anyone can check it out 383.312 - without the need for signing in or logging in. 387.225 - On Zerodha Varsity, you will find three sections: 390.302 - Modules, Videos, and Certified. 393.315 - Inside the modules, all these concepts will be 396.102 - explained in text format. 398.136 - If you only want to do a limited number of modules, 400.959 - then modules 1, 2, 3, and 11 are the ones that 404.483 - you should definitely go through. 406.161 - Instead of reading these modules in text format, 410.268 - you can also understand them through videos. 412.471 - For example, if you click on Module 1, 414.711 - you can see that a total of 10 videos are given. 417.522 - If you go to Videos section and click on 1st module, 421.209 - you'll see that there are 10 chapters here. 423.89 - The concepts are the same, 425.697 - but they are presented in video format. 427.913 - In addition, there is an optional course 430.181 - covered under the Certified section. 432.821 - Based on modules 1, 2, 3, and 11, 436.907 - 100 questions will be asked, which will be MCQs, 440.0 - and you need to attempt them in 100 minutes. 442.639 - If you score more than 65%, 445.603 - you will be issued a certificate, 448.239 - and there is a fee of 250 rupees to apply for it. 451.277 - So, again, this is entirely optional 453.43 - if you want to get certified by Zerodha Varsity. 456.083 - I would recommend that whether you want to get 458.449 - certified or not, at least go through those 4 modules. 461.002 - Let's move on to our final skill, which is 463.72 - financial analytics and data analytics. 466.245 - Look, in most finance roles, 468.604 - it is essential to analyze data to make decisions. 472.367 - Data analytics is a skill that you should learn. 475.494 - And for this, there are two levels of courses. 477.892 - Both are offered by the same university. 480.258 - The first course is a beginner-level course, 482.368 - and the second is an intermediate-level course. 484.847 - You can find both courses on the Coursera website. 488.042 - The name of the first course is 489.384 - \"Financial Analysis of Scenarios and Decisions.\" 492.407 - The 2nd course which is an intermediate-level course, 494.816 - is called \"Applying Data Analytics in Finance.\" 498.18 - This course is a bit tough. 500.631 - If you check its syllabus, it's somewhat complicated. 504.607 - The level of analytics is higher and 506.905 - the models you need to learn are a bit challenging. 509.143 - I would recommend if you want to learn the basics, 512.103 - simply go for the first one; it will be sufficient for you. 515.706 - So, we have discussed the 5 skills and their resources.  519.609 - I will share a secret website with you that 522.488 - I am definitely sure will help you. 524.86 - This website is \"LinkedIn Job Description Template\".  528.663 - LinkedIn has created this website for recruiters. 532.058 - If they want to hire for any position, 535.281 - what skills they should look for and 537.725 - what interview questions they should ask. 539.709 - This way, you can practice for any role 542.112 - and see what skills are required. 544.759 - Personally, I found this to be a very useful resource.  547.435 - You try once and see. 548.951 - Apart from this, my final request is that 551.746 - you let me know the reason you watch this channel, 555.278 - whether it's for internships, courses, scholarships, 558.477 - MBA, or whatever your reason is for watching videos. 562.267 - Please comment, as that will help me understand 565.0 - what type of videos I should make in the future. 567.463 - I truly hope that this information helps you. 569.537 - Thank you so much for watching this, 571.111 - and see you the next time, guys."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 00:00 - Introduction and Overview 00:12 -

It's 137.387 - not just about learning abstract concepts, but rather on doing and applying. 141.558 - The main issue that I see is that if you're looking 143.351 - for a role towards the analytics, it's not going to be the best course for you. 147.23 - But the next course definitely is. 148.982 - Number two, the Google Data Analytics cert, and it's a very popular 152.694 - and well known course, so I'm not going to talk 154.362 - that much about it, but I still need to mention it. 157.031 - It has 4.8 stars, six months, 158.825 - a 10 hours per week and nearly 2 million people enrolled. 162.704 - The courses in this program are structured 164.372 - according to the data analytics lifecycle. 166.541 - So you start by asking 167.375 - questions, preparing data, processing data, analyzing, sharing data, 170.879 - and also some programing an hour on the side and a final capstone project. 174.674 - The purpose of this course is how accessible it is for beginners. 177.427 - It's also a very well known course and a nice introduction to the field. 181.014 - The downsides are that it's not the most practical course. 183.641 - It's very beginner level and very theoretical, 185.977 - and you'll learn more instead of Python. 187.854 - A Next up, I have something that I think is 189.397 - even better, and we have the advanced Google Analytics certificate. 192.901 - And before 193.276 - we get into all the more advanced courses, let's just cover this one. 196.196 - Now, this is an extension of the original data analytics course, but in this one 200.325 - you'll work a lot with Python instead, and that's a huge plus. 203.786 - Oh, it says advanced level really is just means a level above the original course. 208.124 - It's not an advanced course by any means. 210.46 - A beginner can still take this, but I still recommend that you take the 213.254 - first course first, but you can take it without taking the first course. 217.217 - If that makes sense. 217.926 - It's also six months, 10 hours per week, slightly more focused on other 221.179 - data science skills, not just the classic tasks of a data analyst. 224.724 - The first course is foundations. 226.309 - Course, too, is about introduction to Python and then about translating data 229.854 - into insights course for about statistics and then regression analysis. 234.442 - Next, you learn about machine 235.777 - learning for 37 hours, so you will be able to learn quite a bit. 239.656 - Of course, 240.281 - not go super in-depth because you don't really have that foundation and at last 243.993 - you'll have a capstone project. 245.203 - The good thing about this course is that it's very general 247.83 - and focusing on a lot of different data science skills while still 250.75 - focusing on data analytics mainly, it also includes a ton of python. 254.879 - Now the big downside is that there's going to be 256.589 - no sequel in this course at all, unfortunately, which is a shame. 260.343 - All right. 260.718 - Moving on to number four, IBM data science. 263.054 - This course has a 4.6 rating of over 60,000 people, and that's a very good 267.767 - score. 268.268 - It's a beginner level course and a five months at 10 hours per week. 271.396 - Supposed to prepare you for a career in data science 273.94 - like data scientist, junior data scientist and data architect. 277.735 - Now, I personally think it's slightly 279.487 - misleading because if you don't have any experience or degree, 282.782 - it's going to be very tough to land a data scientist job after this course, 286.744 - if not, absolutely impossible, but it can definitely help you start. 289.831 - So let's go through these courses really quick. 291.791 - First, we have an introduction to data science. 294.043 - You learn about all the tools, 295.253 - the methodology, and then get working hands on with Python for data science. 299.465 - You'll do a project with Python in course four, 301.926 - which is a huge plus projects to help you learn, 304.47 - but they're also really useful later when we look for jobs. 307.098 - Since the portfolio and the quality projects 309.309 - make you stand out from the competition, then the next few courses are all 312.729 - about databases and sequel and data analysis with Python data visualization. 317.483 - And as you can see, everything is about Python, 319.569 - and that's a very good thing because it's such a useful skill to learn. 323.323 - Finally, we have machine 324.157 - learning in a capstone project, so throwing in some other stuff as well. 327.201 - The pros and cons of this course is that Python is a huge plus. 330.33 - I also like to focus on projects and applying what you've learned. 332.915 - It's also very general course and that's a good thing, 335.543 - but it can also be a little bit of a bad thing. 337.211 - If you're looking for a specific thing, then maybe it's not the best course. 340.548 - Could be a course that's more specific and better for you. 343.092 - So consider the opportunity cost of taking this course. 345.97 - If there's a course that's better for you, you should definitely take that. 348.473 - Instead, let's move on to number five, Microsoft Power by the analyst. 353.353 - I promise this is the last analytics course 355.855 - and but I just had to mention this one. 357.523 - This is a relatively new course where you learn the basics of detail, 361.319 - the skills that really focus on power by the visualization 364.697 - to 4.6 out of five reading by months are 10 hours per week. 368.326 - And it's for beginners, of course. 369.952 - Of course. 370.328 - One is about preparing data with Excel. 372.455 - Next, an introduction to Power BI and then ETL in Power BI later 377.001 - modeling and Power BI data analysis. 379.003 - And this in power by creating, designing, deploying and maintaining assets 382.965 - and a final capstone project. 384.55 - And in the last course you will get the opportunity to prepare 387.47 - for the PLF 300 exam, which gets you Microsoft Certified. 392.016 - If you do decide to take it. 393.643 - The main benefit of this course is that it's directly by Microsoft 397.605 - who owns Power BI, 398.648 - and it's going to help you prepare for the exam to get certified. 401.651 - The downside is that you'll definitely have to supplemented with 404.695 - other courses, for example, on sequel or Python or something. 408.074 - It doesn't really cover those aspects and it's a very niche course on Power. 411.953 - BI But still really useful if that's what you looking to learn. 414.914 - All right, next up, we have The Machine Learning Course 417.125 - by Andrew, a very popular instructor with great teaching. 420.42 - I mean, look at the 4.9 review. 422.422 - It's for beginners looking to break into a and machine learning and a pretty short 426.634 - course are just two months, 10 hours of studying per week. 430.096 - It comes with three main courses supervised machine learning, 433.683 - advanced learning algorithms and finally unsupervised learning. 437.854 - For this one, it's more interesting to take a look at what you're going to learn. 441.315 - So you're going to build machine learning models and also trained 444.277 - supervised models. 445.695 - You will apply the best practices for email development 448.698 - as well as deal with unsupervised learning. 451.242 - You'll also build and train a neural network using TensorFlow 454.537 - and you'll do a lot more stuff. 456.038 - The point of this course isn't to make you a machine learning expert or something, 459.5 - but rather give you a nice introduction to the field and many different areas 462.879 - of machine learning. 463.588 - And then you can continue from there you will learn a ton. 466.299 - The certificate looks great as well because it says machine learning. 469.51 - So if you want to move more towards the field, it can be nice to have a search 472.889 - for machine learning. There are many proofs for this one. 475.475 - ML and A.I. skills are highly in demand. 478.269 - It's a top quality course approved by Stanford 480.813 - and one of their most famous teachers 482.482 - and deep learning A.I., and it's available in eight different languages now. 486.402 - It's also really nice to, you know, break into a field 488.779 - that's generally difficult to grasp for beginners. 491.491 - So I highly recommend this course. 493.034 - All right. Let's move on to number seven. 495.244 - This one is slightly different, 496.537 - but I need to include this one because it's an untapped opportunity. 499.665 - The IBM Data engineer certificate is a pretty unknown program. 504.42 - To be honest. 504.962 - There are not that many students enrolled, only 8000, 508.257 - but a 4.6 rating from these people, which is really, really good. 511.844 - And I think it's an untapped opportunity to be honest. It's for beginners. 514.722 - No specific programing skills are required and it only takes five months 518.142 - or 10 hours per week. Let's take a look at the courses. 520.269 - We have an introduction to the field first next to Python 523.564 - and more specifically, a course for data science. 525.9 - And this one was actually included in the other IBM program 529.153 - like a few of these other courses, because the skills overlap 532.24 - between the data scientist, 533.324 - they download this data engineer, there are skills that overlap. 535.826 - Next, a Python project for Data Engineering Introduction 538.663 - to Relational databases and Relational database management systems. 542.5 - Of course, five is about skill and Python, then a Linux and Shell course 546.379 - a course about relational database administration and of course about ETL 549.966 - and data pipelines, which are very, very important for data engineer. 553.594 - Then we have some data warehousing and B analytics, NoSQL databases 557.348 - and finally some big data and machine learning. 560.142 - They are really throwing in a lot in this course. 562.27 - And finally, a capstone project to top it all off. 564.647 - Now, what about the pros and cons about this course? 566.607 - I think it's a very comprehensive course, perhaps even a little bit 569.986 - too many things in this course, considering what you're going to be doing 573.239 - as a data engineer. 574.115 - You know, 574.282 - it doesn't cover the exact skills, but rather gives you a ton of stuff 578.077 - and then it kind of covers those skills as well. 580.162 - The engineering is a very exciting field with many high paying jobs available. 584.375 - And what I don't like is how they claim to get you 586.419 - job ready in less than five months with no prior experience 589.422 - as a data engineer, that's probably not going to be true. 592.592 - I haven't seen it myself and from my research it's 594.76 - very hard to land it the engineering role without experience or degree. 598.389 - This seems like a little bit of a stretch, 599.974 - unfortunately, but still a very valuable course. 602.768 - All right, we're nearly there. 604.186 - But first, I want to talk about Python for everybody. 607.148 - This course is over. 608.024 - 1.5 million students enrolled, 4.8 stars 611.861 - in total from over 200,000 people. 614.864 - Super popular course at only 10 hours and two months to complete it. 618.576 - And the purpose of this course is to teach Python to absolute beginners, 622.705 - but then it gets more and more advanced 624.582 - and the focus is on analyzing data with Python in the later courses. 628.419 - The course one is about programing and fundamentals. 631.881 - Next data structures in Python and then a practical course 635.259 - using Python to access web data. 637.386 - Finally, databases with Python and the Capstone project about retrieving, 641.557 - processing and visualizing data with Python. 644.602 - I think it's a great course. A great teacher. 646.479 - Professor Shook and Perfect for Beginners looking to really build up 649.69 - their Python knowledge from scratch and focus on using Python to analyze data. 653.527 - What I will say 654.111 - though, is that if you're going to be using this, 655.613 - I recommend combining it 656.739 - with like with three schools or something to give you more practice opportunities. 660.076 - I did take a part of this course 661.619 - and I kind of realized that it was a lot of videos 663.663 - and not as much practice as I would have liked to see, 665.79 - but the videos can be very helpful to give you that foundational knowledge 669.126 - that you don't necessarily get if you only practice. 671.712 - You also have to learn the theoretical parts. 673.714 - I'm going to leave a link to all the courses in the description, 676.133 - and if you're considering starting a course, 677.885 - I promise you that in the future you're going to thank yourself 680.596 - for starting today. 681.722 - That's all for this video. 682.765 - Have an amazing week, guys, and watch this video next."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 00:00 - Introduction: Why Learn Data Science 00:23 - Benefits of Learning Data Science Skills 00:52 - Coursera: A Platform for Learning Data Science 01:18 - Overview of Top 8 Data Science Courses 01:42 - Course 1: Applied Data Science with Python 02:45 - Structure and Content of the Course 03:41 - Pros and Cons of the Course 04:10 - Course 2: Google Data Analytics Certificate 04:50 - Highlights of the Course 05:37 - Course 3: Advanced Google Analytics Certificate 06:29 - Structure and Key Features 07:03 - Course 4: IBM Data Science Certificate 08:02 - Projects and Hands-On Learning 08:41 - Course 5: Microsoft Power BI Analyst 09:35 - Preparing for the PLF 300 Certification 10:12 - Course 6: Machine Learning by Andrew Ng 10:58 - Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts 11:39 - Course 7: IBM Data Engineer Certificate 12:42 - Exploring Data Engineering Topics 13:30 - Course 8: Python for Everybody 14:24 - Building Python Skills for Beginners 15:02 - Combining Python Learning with Practical Tools 15:49 - Final Advice: Start Your Data Science Journey 16:14 - Closing Remarks and Next Steps"}]}

There are so many locations that this\u00a0 series has introduced or given us a fresh new\u00a0\u00a0 10.88 - look at, but that seems to be going under the\u00a0 radar. And I suspect that has to do with the\u00a0\u00a0 15.68 - fact the exact locations of these courses are\u00a0 often unknown. So how about we change that? I\u00a0\u00a0 22.36 - wanna go through every Nitro course in Mario\u00a0 Kart 8 Deluxe and try to figure out where in\u00a0\u00a0 27.72 - the Mushroom Kingdom or beyond they might\u00a0 be located. We\u2019ll save Retro courses for\u00a0\u00a0 32.84 - their own game of origin, so let me know\u00a0 if that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. 36.84 - We\u2019re gonna start with the Mushroom Cup of course,\u00a0 which kicks off with the surprisingly difficult\u00a0\u00a0 41.56 - Mario Kart Stadium. There is little in terms\u00a0 of scenery here and the theme doesn\u2019t help much\u00a0\u00a0 47.04 - either, considering it\u2019s probably fair to assume\u00a0 at this point that even in-universe Mario Kart is\u00a0\u00a0 52.68 - a worldwide phenomenon. That said, the skyscrapers\u00a0 in the background tell us this stadium is at\u00a0\u00a0 58.64 - least located in a large city, unlike some other\u00a0 circuits we\u2019ve seen in the past, which appeared\u00a0\u00a0 63.84 - to be more in the middle of nowhere. While the\u00a0 only place we\u2019ve actually seen skyscrapers like\u00a0\u00a0 69.56 - that in the main series is in New Donk City, I\u00a0 would say Mushroom City in the Mushroom Kingdom\u00a0\u00a0 74.72 - is a more likely location for this course,\u00a0 but, again, it\u2019s a tricky one to start with. 80.8 - Next is Water Park, which is actually a bit of\u00a0 a strange location design-wise, because it isn\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0 86.2 - entirely clear whether this location is supposed\u00a0 to be flooded or whether that\u2019s accidental. The\u00a0\u00a0 92.04 - name implies it\u2019s the entire point of the park,\u00a0 but at the same time, an underwater merry-go-round\u00a0\u00a0 97.88 - is a strange attraction. Anyway, we\u2019re not here\u00a0 to rag on the park, but to pin down the location,\u00a0\u00a0 104.16 - which is again not easy to do. The huge W on the\u00a0 ferris wheel may suggest a connection to Wario,\u00a0\u00a0 110.44 - but that is not the case. The design is different\u00a0 from how his W is usually portrayed and any\u00a0\u00a0 115.76 - further connections aren\u2019t present. Based on how\u00a0 this sign showing how tall you must be depicts a\u00a0\u00a0 120.92 - Goomba and Mario as reference, I would say this is\u00a0 probably another location in the Mushroom Kingdom,\u00a0\u00a0 126.56 - but it is also likely it\u2019s probably located\u00a0 somewhere closer to Isle Delfino as well. The\u00a0\u00a0 132.4 - reason for this is that Nokis can be seen\u00a0 visiting the park and we haven\u2019t seen them\u00a0\u00a0 137.12 - outside of Isle Delfino too often. They\u2019re also\u00a0 not common crowd members in Mario Kart 8 at all,\u00a0\u00a0 143.4 - this is the only Nitro course they appear\u00a0 in in fact, so that is significant. 148.28 - The next course in the Mushroom Cup is Sweet\u00a0 Sweet Canyon and this is finally one where\u00a0\u00a0 152.92 - I can confidently say I know where it is. I\u00a0 would be absolutely shocked if this location\u00a0\u00a0 158.92 - isn\u2019t far beyond the Mushroom Kingdom, in the\u00a0 depths of space, somewhere near or around the\u00a0\u00a0 164.76 - Sweet Sweet Galaxy that appears in Mario Galaxy\u00a0 1. The name is the same, the design is similar,\u00a0\u00a0 171.52 - there is nothing visible in Sweet Sweet\u00a0 Canyon to suggest it\u2019s anywhere near the\u00a0\u00a0 176.08 - familiar Mario world and the course even appears\u00a0 on advertisements for Galaxy Air. Yeah, this is a\u00a0\u00a0 182.04 - closed case for me. Unfortunately, the last course\u00a0 of the Mushroom Cup is far from a slam dunk and is\u00a0\u00a0 188.84 - probably the hardest one to pin down in the entire\u00a0 game. And that\u2019s a shame, because Thwomp Ruins is\u00a0\u00a0 194.72 - a very cool and intriguing location, but there\u00a0 are no landmarks to go off whatsoever and this\u00a0\u00a0 200.44 - is not a locale we\u2019ve seen too often in Mario\u00a0 games, even spin-offs. So yeah, unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0 206.76 - beyond a general connection to perhaps Thwomp\u00a0 Volcano from Partners in Time thematically, there\u00a0\u00a0 211.84 - isn\u2019t much to say about Thwomp Ruins, but if you\u00a0 have any ideas, share them in the comments below. 217.12 - Onto the Flower Cup, where the courses may be\u00a0 getting a little harder but pinning down their\u00a0\u00a0 221.32 - location actually does not. Mario Circuit is\u00a0 incredibly obvious, since the most prominent\u00a0\u00a0 226.76 - landmark of the Mushroom Kingdom is located\u00a0 right in the center of it. The scale and giant\u00a0\u00a0 231.84 - zero gravity race course around it is definitely\u00a0 new, but this unmistakably Princess Peach Castle,\u00a0\u00a0 238.0 - so that is easily solved. Toad Harbor\u2019s\u00a0 location is also quite easy to figure out,\u00a0\u00a0 243.28 - as the entire race course is really just a new\u00a0 addition to the Mushroom Kingdom. While the\u00a0\u00a0 247.92 - town itself is based on San Francisco, the in-game\u00a0 version is clearly meant to just be a coastal city\u00a0\u00a0 253.16 - in the Mushroom Kingdom. The Statue of Liberty\u00a0 featuring Peach and the many references to Mario,\u00a0\u00a0 258.28 - Luigi and Wario make all the more clear\u00a0 this is a Mushroom Kingdom location. Also\u00a0\u00a0 263.48 - interesting to note is that wherever on the\u00a0 coast of the Mushroom Kingdom this course is,\u00a0\u00a0 267.8 - N64 Rainbow Road is located right above it,\u00a0 as can be seen when racing on that course. 273.24 - While Twisted Mansion may appear at first sight\u00a0 to be based and set around Luigi\u2019s Mansion,\u00a0\u00a0 278.2 - it\u2019s actually more likely to be a\u00a0 Ghost House-turned race course. And\u00a0\u00a0 282.48 - specifically one of the Ghost Houses seen\u00a0 in New Super Mario Bros 2. The reason for\u00a0\u00a0 287.32 - that is the prominent statue of Boohemoth, a\u00a0 Big Boo that only appears in that 3DS game,\u00a0\u00a0 293.04 - meaning there is most likely some connection\u00a0 between this Ghost House and the two in the\u00a0\u00a0 297.28 - game where Boohemoth appears. Shy Guy Falls is the\u00a0 hardest location to pin down in this Cup by far,\u00a0\u00a0 303.96 - because the only real connection to be\u00a0 made is to a fellow Mario Kart course,\u00a0\u00a0 308.28 - Wario\u2019s Gold Mine. Both are mining areas where\u00a0 Shy Guys work under the flag of Shy Guy Metals,\u00a0\u00a0 314.64 - so those two being related seems likely, but the\u00a0 locale of Shy Guy Falls itself is not something\u00a0\u00a0 320.48 - we\u2019ve seen often in the Mario games. Don\u2019t\u00a0 get me wrong, waterfalls have appeared before,\u00a0\u00a0 325.8 - but never surrounded by this kind of landscape.\u00a0 Probably the closest resemblance can be found in\u00a0\u00a0 331.08 - the Mario Movie, during this section that\u00a0 references the flying Cheep Cheep stages\u00a0\u00a0 335.32 - from Super Mario Bros., so maybe that is a\u00a0 nearby location? It\u2019s hard to say for sure. 340.88 - Onto the Star Cup, which opens with Sunshine\u00a0 Airport. This is clearly a location somewhere\u00a0\u00a0 346.12 - on Isle Delfino we didn\u2019t get to visit during\u00a0 Super Mario Sunshine, the theming is abundantly\u00a0\u00a0 351.52 - clear. Not only do Mario, Peach and Toadsworth\u00a0 literally arrive at Isle Delfino by plane,\u00a0\u00a0 357.92 - the weather is also a perfect match, as is of\u00a0 course the theming of the airport around Shine\u00a0\u00a0 362.48 - Sprites. Considering there are still locations\u00a0 on Isle Delfino we don\u2019t see in Sunshine,\u00a0\u00a0 367.8 - it seems obvious to me that is where Sunshine\u00a0 Airport is. While the next course, Dolphin Shoals,\u00a0\u00a0 373.28 - is also clearly set in a tropical climate,\u00a0 we actually know for a fact it isn\u2019t anywhere\u00a0\u00a0 378.28 - near Isle Delfino. The reason for that is that\u00a0 Sunshine Airport offers flights from Isle Delfino\u00a0\u00a0 383.92 - to Dolphin Shoals, which wouldn\u2019t be necessary\u00a0 if they were both on the same island, although\u00a0\u00a0 388.88 - I guess it is possible Dolphin Shoals is on one\u00a0 of the surrounding islands we see in the intro of\u00a0\u00a0 393.92 - Sunshine. That said, I think it\u2019s much more likely\u00a0 this course is on a different island entirely,\u00a0\u00a0 399.84 - being Dinosaur Island from Super Mario World.\u00a0 And the reason for that is very simple:\u00a0\u00a0 405.68 - Dolphins are surprisingly rare in the Mario\u00a0 world. They\u2019re only ever found on Dinosaur Island,\u00a0\u00a0 411.92 - in the Vanilla Dome to be specific, and spin-offs\u00a0 with unspecified locations, so the chances of\u00a0\u00a0 417.96 - Dolphin Shoals being in the Vanilla Dome on\u00a0 Dinosaur Island are quite large I would say. 423.28 - Next is Electrodrome, which is a very unusual\u00a0 location for the Mario series. A nightclub, where\u00a0\u00a0 429.64 - raves are held is nothing we see too often and\u00a0 since we don\u2019t get a look at the club\u2019s exterior,\u00a0\u00a0 435.12 - it\u2019s extremely hard to say where this might be.\u00a0 Based on the general dark theme, lack of Toads\u00a0\u00a0 440.76 - around and the constant Larry Koopa mentions\u00a0 around the course, I\u2019m thinking this course\u00a0\u00a0 445.32 - may be set somewhere in Bowser\u2019s Kingdom, the\u00a0 not-too-often seen region where Bowser Castle is\u00a0\u00a0 450.52 - located. I could especially see Electrodrome being\u00a0 somewhere in Neo Bowser City, that seems fitting.\u00a0\u00a0 457.88 - The final track for this Cup is Mount Wario,\u00a0 which is both a snowy mountain and a ski resort,\u00a0\u00a0 463.44 - with especially the latter being another location\u00a0 we don\u2019t see too often in the Mario series. We\u00a0\u00a0 468.72 - have seen so many snowscapes and mountainous peaks\u00a0 over the course of the series that it\u2019s basically\u00a0\u00a0 473.68 - impossible to figure out which one Wario could\u00a0 have possibly turned into a business venture,\u00a0\u00a0 478.72 - especially since thematically, the most similar\u00a0 locales are actually found in Mario & Sonic at the\u00a0\u00a0 484.04 - Olympic Winter Games. But yeah, those are set in\u00a0 real life, so I don\u2019t know how feasible that is\u2026 489.96 - Onto the Special Cup, which begins with a very\u00a0 peculiar setting in Cloudtop Cruise. While we\u00a0\u00a0 495.48 - can\u2019t exactly pin it down, it\u2019s clear this is\u00a0 set somewhere in the skies of a traditional Mario\u00a0\u00a0 500.76 - course. We have a giant question mark block with a\u00a0 beanstalk growing out of it and plenty of Bowser\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 506.28 - airships around, both of which are staples of\u00a0 the classic 2D titles and found high up above\u00a0\u00a0 511.76 - the standard levels. I\u2019ve looked into whether\u00a0 there are any levels that feature both vines as\u00a0\u00a0 517.12 - well as an airship, but the answer as far as I\u00a0 could find is \u2018no\u2019, so we can\u2019t precisely nail\u00a0\u00a0 522.76 - down where this course may be located. Bone-Dry\u00a0 Dunes is actually in a similar position in that\u00a0\u00a0 528.16 - it is clearly based on desert themes, as are very\u00a0 common in Mario games, but we can\u2019t precisely nail\u00a0\u00a0 534.08 - down where this track is found. There are no\u00a0 desert levels I know with sand this deeply red,\u00a0\u00a0 540.28 - which would\u2019ve been a very easy tell for a\u00a0 potential location. The giant rock bearing the\u00a0\u00a0 545.16 - image of Dry Bowser may suggest this location is\u00a0 in Bowser territory though, which may explain why\u00a0\u00a0 551.2 - the sand looks so different from the more yellow\u00a0 color we encounter more often. In which case,\u00a0\u00a0 556.8 - it would at least be in the same kingdom as\u00a0 the next course, Bowser\u2019s Castle. While there\u00a0\u00a0 561.52 - are some Bowser\u2019s Castle tracks throughout the\u00a0 series based on more specific castles, this one\u00a0\u00a0 566.88 - is a quite generic one and most likely just meant\u00a0 to be his general castle, as we most often see it\u00a0\u00a0 572.56 - in the Super Mario titles. Mario Kart 8\u2019s version\u00a0 of Rainbow Road is difficult to literally place,\u00a0\u00a0 578.64 - since we see nothing note beneath the course, like\u00a0 was the case with aforementioned N64 Rainbow Road,\u00a0\u00a0 584.44 - but it can\u2019t be too far off Mario\u2019s version\u00a0 of earth either. The reason for that is\u00a0\u00a0 588.84 - because we drive in between satellites and\u00a0 space stations belonging to Mario Kart TV,\u00a0\u00a0 594.2 - the broadcaster of the game, and REXA, which is\u00a0 a sponsor that stands for Rainbow Exploration\u00a0\u00a0 599.76 - Agency. It\u2019s a reference to the real life Japanese\u00a0 space research organization JAXA. But since these\u00a0\u00a0 606.48 - satellites presumably orbit around Mario\u2019s earth,\u00a0 we at least know this version of Rainbow Road\u00a0\u00a0 611.96 - isn\u2019t as far out in the galaxy as Mario\u2019s\u00a0 adventures in the Galaxy games for example. 617.28 - On to the DLC courses, many of which are very\u00a0 obviously not set in the Mushroom Kingdom,\u00a0\u00a0 622.56 - or the Mario Universe really, at all. But for the\u00a0 sake of completion, let\u2019s quickly tackle these as\u00a0\u00a0 628.08 - well. Hyrule Circuit is set in Hyrule, the region\u00a0 where the majority of Legend of Zelda games take\u00a0\u00a0 633.6 - place. Mute City and Big Blue are both locations\u00a0 in the F-Zero universe, which doesn\u2019t really have\u00a0\u00a0 639.64 - a name, similar to Excitebike Arena and the\u00a0 Excitebike\u2026universe. Animal Crossing is based\u00a0\u00a0 646.08 - on a generic Animal Crossing town, which is kind\u00a0 of the whole world in most of these games. Much\u00a0\u00a0 651.8 - more interesting are the original courses set in\u00a0 the Mario world, the first of which was Dragon\u00a0\u00a0 656.56 - Driftway. Now, a recurring image in this track\u00a0 is Gobblegut, a boss from Mario Galaxy 2, but\u00a0\u00a0 663.04 - there\u2019s no way this course is set in the galaxies\u00a0 where it can be found in that game. The location\u00a0\u00a0 668.04 - appears to be more Chinese inspired, with Lakitus\u00a0 also prominently featured, although that doesn\u2019t\u00a0\u00a0 673.52 - help us too much either. Probably the biggest hint\u00a0 can be found in the music, which contains some\u00a0\u00a0 679.04 - elements from the theme for the Chai Kingdom that\u00a0 appears in Super Mario Land. Seeing as this region\u00a0\u00a0 684.2 - in Sarasaland is also based on China, it does\u00a0 seem like the most likely map location for this\u00a0\u00a0 690.32 - course. Didn\u2019t expect to pin a course down for\u00a0 Sarasaland in this video, but hey, it checks out. 696.68 - Next is Ice Ice Outpost, which is basically\u00a0 impossible to pin down. There is nothing\u00a0\u00a0 702.2 - recognizable here from a landmark standpoint, as\u00a0 icy worlds like this one are super common, and we\u00a0\u00a0 708.04 - have not seen oil drilling anywhere else in the\u00a0 Mario series as far as I can remember. There is\u00a0\u00a0 712.92 - an advertisement here for a Toad Polar Expedition\u00a0 though, suggesting that world map-wise, this might\u00a0\u00a0 718.64 - be the Mario equivalent to the North or South\u00a0 Pole, in which case the Snow Kingdom and Shiveria\u00a0\u00a0 724.12 - from Mario Odyssey might not be too far away. Wild\u00a0 Woods probably is, seeing as the course is located\u00a0\u00a0 730.64 - in a forest of giant trees. While we have seen\u00a0 countless of huge trees throughout all corners\u00a0\u00a0 736.28 - of the Mario series, none appear to be quite a\u00a0 match to what this course offers, especially when\u00a0\u00a0 741.88 - looking at the indoor sections with the houses.\u00a0 I guess the Boggly Woods from Paper Mario: The\u00a0\u00a0 747.36 - Thousand Year Door are not too dissimilar, but it\u00a0 doesn\u2019t feel right to call this the same area. The\u00a0\u00a0 752.6 - Wooded Kingdom does bear a bit of a resemblance\u00a0 to the Wild Woods, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m confident\u00a0\u00a0 757.72 - these two are near one another. It\u2019s simply the\u00a0 best guess we have. One that we can pin down\u00a0\u00a0 763.16 - though is Super Bell Subway, which is actually\u00a0 set in a subway station known as the Golden Bell.\u00a0\u00a0 768.88 - It also features a map of the city it\u2019s located\u00a0 in, with Toad Harbor marked as well, informing us\u00a0\u00a0 774.52 - that it is close by. There is also a subway rail\u00a0 map available featuring all the courses of Mario\u00a0\u00a0 780.28 - Kart 8 on it, Retro tracks included, but this\u00a0 really tells us more about the quality of these\u00a0\u00a0 785.48 - subways than the locations of the courses. After\u00a0 all, you\u2019re not gonna tell me Moo Moo Meadows,\u00a0\u00a0 791.04 - Twisted Mansion and Sherbet Land are close\u00a0 together, that makes no sense. Especially\u00a0\u00a0 796.16 - since Moo Meadows is actually marked on the city\u00a0 map from earlier, as being just outside the city,\u00a0\u00a0 801.96 - relatively close to Toad Harbor and the Subway\u00a0 itself. So yeah, the rail map makes no in-universe\u00a0\u00a0 807.92 - sense and I don\u2019t consider it a reliable source.\u00a0 And since the Booster Course Pass only features\u00a0\u00a0 813.04 - Retro tracks or courses brought over from Tour,\u00a0 this was the final track to cover on this video. 818.8 - What are your theories as to where Mario Kart 8\u2019s\u00a0 courses are located?

Well, in that case, why don't you guys just introduce yourselves? 58.036 - Mr. Clifford: OK. I'm Mr. Clifford, and I'm a high school economics teacher and YouTuber, 61.395 - and I'm going to focus on\u00a0 teaching you the theories\u00a0 63.39 - and graphs of economics. You\u00a0 know, the textbook stuff. 65.43 - Adriene: And I'm Adriene Hill; I'm a senior reporter for the public radio show Marketplace, 68.58 - and I'm gonna focus on showing you the real world applications of economics. You know, 72.54 - the good stuff. The really fun stuff. 74.176 - Mr. Clifford: Hey! We're\u00a0 both fun! We're definitely\u00a0 76.26 - not gonna teach economics like this: 77.557 - Prof. Bunsen Honeydew: Welcome to CrashCourse Economics (Beaker yawns) I am thrilled to 80.85 - be teaching you this fascinating subject. (Beaker moans) 82.846 - Mr. Clifford: I'm sorry\u00a0 Professor Honeydew, but that's\u00a0 87.96 - why people hate economics\u00a0 in high school and college. 89.91 - Adriene: Anyway, Statler and Waldorf have a point, the most important question in economics 94.08 - is \"Where's John Green?\" I mean everyone knows he won a bronze medal in economics at the 97.86 - Alabama State Academic Decathlon. Well, John Green\u00a0 100.71 - isn't hosting because\u00a0 economics. We'll explain later. 104.01 - [Theme Music] 110.346 - Mr. Clifford: So let's start with the basics. What is economics? Well it might be easier 116.36 - to term it what economics isn't. Economics is not the study of money or getting rich, 119.87 - although understanding economics can help with that. Economics is not the study of the 122.93 - stock market. It's just not. And economics is not primarily about men in bow-ties forecasting 127.58 - what will happen in a given market or the overall economy. Actually, a few economists 130.67 - do that, but that's not the main focus of economics. 132.44 - Economics is the study of people and choices. The famous economist Alfred Marsh defined 137.33 - economics as \"A study of man (Adriene: And woman!) in the ordinary business of life. 141.56 - It inquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side the 145.85 - study of wealth and on the other and more\u00a0 147.59 - important side a study of\u00a0 man (Adriene: And woman).\" 150.11 - Adriene: So let's talk a minute about what else econ is. Economics is an 18 year old 154.7 - deciding whether to work or go to college and how that affects her future income. Economics is 158.99 - a company deciding whether to produce smartphones or tablets and how that's influenced by what 163.13 - we consumers want to buy. Economics is the government deciding whether to increase its 167.99 - spending when it's a recession and if it's worth going into debt. 170.78 - So despite what you might think, economics is not boring and dull. OK, some of it is, 178.43 - but it's not all like that I promise! It's awesome. Understanding econ can forever change 184.16 - the way you think and problem-solve. Our job over the next 40 weeks is to teach you concepts 189.14 - that will help you understand the world, and hopefully make it a better place. 192.53 - No matter who you are, you\u00a0 will be using economics.\u00a0 196.61 - In fact, pewww! You are using econ right now, 199.79 - you made a choice to watch this video, that means you must feel that the benefit outweighs 204.02 - the cost. You might be thinking \"This is YouTube, there's no cost,\" but sure there is. You could 209.18 - be watching videos of kittens or skaters falling on their face or charlie biting fingers. Ow! 213.14 - The cost of watching this\u00a0 video is the video you're\u00a0 216.02 - not watching, the value of\u00a0 the next best alternative. 218.87 - Economists call this your opportunity cost. If you're still watching this video it means 223.82 - that you believe it's the best use of your time, or you wouldn't be watching it. \"But 227.66 - what if I'm watching this at school?\" you ask, \"What if I'm forced to watch this?\" Well, 231.23 - you weren't forced to go to school, you could ditch, you could drop out, you could move 234.02 - to a country that doesn't have compulsory education. But the cost would outweigh the 237.59 - benefit. Even if you are at school, you're not forced to watch the video, you could close 241.1 - your eyes or put your head down. No one's gonna pry your eyes open, that'd be creepy! 244.62 - Now let's talk about why John Green isn't\u00a0 247.08 - here teaching this course.\u00a0 John is an entrepreneur, 249.78 - he writes books, runs DFTBA, Vlogbrothers, and Mental_Floss and creates movies, but he can't 254.46 - do everything he wants to\u00a0 do. He looked at the benefits\u00a0 256.92 - and costs of his choices, and in the end decided 259.23 - to spend more time writing books, so Mr. Clifford and I are jumping in to teach you economics. 263.926 - Mr. Clifford: And believe it or not, we just covered the two most important assumptions 266.94 - in all of economics. First, the idea of scarcity. People have unlimited wants but limited resources, 270.96 - and second, everything and I mean everything has a cost. And if these assumptions are true, 274.92 - then we need a way to analyze our choices and get the most from our limited resources. 277.92 - And that's economics. 279.33 - Adriene: Wait, but let's go back to the idea of benefits and costs. About 30,000 people 283.71 - a year die in car accidents in the US. Is there a way to ensure there will never be 287.91 - another traffic fatality? Yes! We can crush all the cars, close all the roads, and force 292.41 - everyone to walk. That would solve the car crash problem. Do you want to decrease the 296.58 - number of people convicted of murder? You could decriminalize murder. You want to end 300.75 - the unethical treatment of elephants? You could\u00a0 303.48 - kill off all the elephants,\u00a0 in an ethical way of course. 306.33 - But before you decide to tenderly euthanize herds of beautiful elephants, think about 312.33 - it for a second. Each of these solutions is absurd because the cost clearly outweighs 316.47 - the benefit. Traffic fatalities are tragic, but we don't prevent them at all costs. You 322.14 - know that driving has risks, that you might get in a car accident, but you still drive. 325.83 - Why? Well first, who's gonna walk to the gym? And walking home with groceries in the rain 330.45 - is way worse than the teeny-tiny chance of dying in a car crash. The point is, individuals, 335.79 - businesses, and countries can't have everything, so they're forced to weigh the benefits and 340.86 - costs of their decisions and make choices. 342.39 - Let's look at another example. Military spending in the United States is over 600 billion dollars 348.45 - per year, that's close to what the next top ten countries spend combined. There are a 353.97 - total of about 20 active aircraft carriers in the world, and the US has half of them, 357.81 - and it's building more. The opportunity cost of those aircraft carriers could be hospitals, 362.46 - schools, and roads. So, is the US spending too much on the military? Should the US focus 368.37 - on making guns or butter? That is, weapons or consumer goods? 372.166 - Mr. Clifford: And notice the key word here is \"or,\" we can't produce an infinite amount 375.57 - of weapons AND consumer goods because we don't have an infinite amount of workers and farms 379.44 - and factories and raw materials. Scarcity means we must make a choice. The American 383.25 - president Dwight D. Eisenhower explained this best\u00a0 385.35 - in 1953 in a speech about\u00a0 Cold War military buildup. 388.41 - \"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final 392.79 - sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. 397.41 - This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, 401.04 - the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.\" 403.86 - And this is a good time to mention the role of politics in economics; we're not pushing 407.16 - some liberal anti-military policy here. We're just pointing out that military spending has 411.12 - an opportunity cost: The resources not being used for social services like feeding the hungry. 415.41 - We're gonna try not to push a political agenda on you. We're gonna show you both sides and 418.8 - let you decide which one's best. So please don't say \"Mr. Clifford loves capitalism, 422.25 - so he's just a pro-business conservative,\" or \"Adriene's talking about environmental 425.82 - regulations, so she's an anti-business liberal.\" 428.01 - Yeah, we are pro-business and you are too. I mean, where do you think your computer came 431.4 - from? That computer was brought to you by capitalism and the private sector. But that 435.06 - being said, the security and laws, roads, and that traffic ticket you got the other 438.6 - day came from the government. 439.8 - Conservatives and liberals fight over the details, but the free market alone can't solve 443.73 - all of our problems. And the government can't solve all of them either. Government officials 447.39 - use economic theory to guide public policy; their effects are widespread and affect millions 451.44 - of people. Sometimes a theory is flawed, but many times a policy is flawed. Economists 455.91 - adjust theories supported\u00a0 by data and understanding\u00a0 458.73 - of incentives. Having the right incentive is key. 460.74 - Adriene: But the right incentives can be hard to figure out. Take for example public colleges 465.06 - and universities. Many of them used to get state money for each student they enrolled. 469.17 - That meant universities had financial incentives to focus on recruiting as many students as 474.03 - possible, but not actually helping them succeed once they were in class. 477.6 - So states have started changing the incentives. Now, more and more states reward schools for 482.49 - the number of students that complete courses or earn degrees. And in some places this has 487.59 - worked; it's helped schools\u00a0 increase their graduation\u00a0 490.02 - rates by shifting money from marketing budgets 492.12 - to programs to help students do better, but those\u00a0 495.36 - incentives can also backfire\u00a0 if they're poorly designed. 498.03 - A university that gets money for graduates could push students through the program without 502.38 - giving them a good education. It might want to only admit students who come in with super 507.03 - high test scores, instead of considering other factors that might make them good candidates. 511.38 - It might push students into less-rigorous majors. 514.65 - But incentives can help solve problems without adding more resources. You just have to get 519.57 - the incentives right. Many non-economists assume that the way to improve things like 523.83 - healthcare is to spend more money. 525.33 - Economists would point out that the US already spends almost twice as much per person as 530.16 - other rich countries, and in many cases they get worse health outcomes. Economists would 534.99 - also say that rather than spending more money, we need to make sure that insurers, doctors, 538.83 - hospitals, and patients have incentives to produce the most effective care possible at 542.88 - the lowest cost possible. The point is, if you\u00a0 545.46 - mess up the incentives, the\u00a0 policy's not gonna work. 548.25 - When Vietnam was under French colonial rule, the regime issued a bounty on rats to exterminate 553.74 - them, giving money to people for handing in rat tails. I guess because piles off rat bodies 558.99 - were too gross. The plan backfired. To make as much money as possible, the rat-catchers 563.76 - cut the tails off the rats and released them, allowing them to make baby rats. The policy 568.47 - actually increased the rat population. It made things worse. Eek! 571.8 - We'll talk more about this idea of perverse incentives in another video, when we talk 576.75 - about the 2008 financial crisis. Eek again. For now, let's go to the Thought Bubble. 581.7 - Mr. Clifford: Speaking of 2008, people sometimes criticize economists asking \"Why didn't they 585.81 - predict the 2008 financial crisis?\" or, \"why can't they agree on what the government should 589.8 - do or shouldn't do when there's a recession?\" These criticisms fail to distinguish between 593.43 - macroeconomics and microeconomics. 594.45 - Specifically, all these complaints are about macroeconomics. Macro studies the economy 599.07 - as a whole; it looks at the whole nation's output, unemployment, interest rates, government 603.81 - spending, and growth. Macro answers questions like \"Will unemployment rise if there's an 607.23 - increase in taxes?\" \"Will and increase in the money supply boost output or just increase 611.49 - inflation?\" \"Will a slump in European economies cause the US economy to slow down?\" 615.12 - Macroeconomists get more airtime because they predict the direction of the overall economy, 618.69 - and work with the media and businesses and congress and the Federal Reserve, but less 622.56 - than half of all economists are macro economists; there's a whole other side of economics that 626.76 - look at different questions. \"How many workers should we hire to maximize profit?\" \"If our 630.6 - main competitor releases their product in May, when is the best time to release our 633.84 - product?\" and \"which is better for fighting climate change, a gas tax, or increase in 637.59 - fuel efficiency?\" These are all microeconomic questions. They're not about predicting GDP, 641.88 - or measuring unemployment, but they are crucial questions that economists must answer. Also, 646.26 - if you don't know what GDP\u00a0 is or what a high or low\u00a0 648.45 - unemployment rate is don't worry, we'll get there. 650.46 - So macro and micro-economists are two different groups asking different questions under one 653.76 - academic umbrella. If economics was biology,\u00a0 656.16 - macroeconomics would be\u00a0 ecology while microeconomics 658.53 - would be cell biology. If economics was physics, macro would be cosmology and relativity while 663.27 - microeconomics would be Newtonian mechanics. 664.8 - Thanks Thought Bubble! Stan, I've always wanted to say that. Now I can cross it off my bucket 668.13 - list. Now I have \"ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange,\" \"arm wrestle 671.19 - Ben Bernanke,\" and \"swim in a giant pool of money like Uncle Scrooge.\" 673.56 - Adriene: Obviously we're glossing over the details, but we promise to cover everything 677.13 - in the next 40 weeks from supply and demand to monetary policy, we'll cover it all. Except 682.23 - for maybe the giant pools of money. We can't promise you that learning economics will make 686.64 - you wealthy, but we can promise that learning economics will enlighten your mind and make 690.81 - you a more informed decision maker. And that makes us all better off. Thanks so much for 695.52 - joining us. We'll see you next week. 696.75 - Mr. Clifford: Thanks for watching Crash Course Economics. It was made with the help of all 699.57 - of these nice people. They work on the show because there's financial and implicit benefits 703.23 - that cover their opportunity costs.

56.61 - Well, you can actually do that without paying a single dollar right from the comfort of 60.719 - your home. 61.89 - This course is called CS50 and it\u2019s available for free on Youtube. 65.059 - But what makes this course so special that 5 million students have watched it within 69.04 - the first 6 months of posting on Youtube? 70.92 - For starters, the course is taught by Professor David Malan, who has also been called the 75.009 - \"most popular professor at Harvard\". 76.71 - And let me tell you, this guy knows his stuff. 79.189 - We have one more course by him in our top 5 list today. 82.2 - So, stay tuned. 83.2 - The course is designed in a way that even beginners can easily follow along. 86.47 - It starts with the basics of programming using C, but it's not just about coding. 90.1 - CS50 teaches you how to think like a programmer, to break down problems and solve them using 94.259 - logic and critical thinking. 95.899 - And the best part about CS50 is the problem sets. 98.76 - These are weekly assignments that challenge you to put what you've learned into practice. 102.229 - They range from simple tasks like printing out \"Hello, world!\" 105.18 - to building your own search engine. 106.85 - If you have any doubts about whether you will be able to learn programming using this course, 110.219 - go checkout CS50 fairs where the students show off their final projects. 114.009 - From a virtual reality game to a machine learning algorithm, the projects are truly impressive. 118.369 - Link to this course and everything else I discuss today can be found in the description. 125.409 - The hardest part of mastering programming isn't the complexity of the programming itself, 129.33 - but staying consistent with your practice. 131.14 - You start off strong, excited to finish every exercise you can get your hands on, but then 135.379 - life gets in the way. 136.46 - And weeks go by without touching your code editor. 139.08 - We've all been there. 140.29 - To solve this problem, we have a course called \u201c100 Days of Code\u201d by Dr. Angela Yu. 144.86 - And it does exactly what it promises. 147.24 - It makes coding a part of your daily routine, even if it's just for one hour. 150.92 - That\u2019s why I have included this course on my top 5 list even when this course is paid 155.08 - and very long. 156.08 - Btw, this is the only paid course on our list today. 158.909 - But how does this course make sure you stay consistent? 161.459 - This course provides daily coding challenges and real world projects that help you stay 165.25 - on track. 166.25 - Even though the main focus of this course is learning Python, it also introduces some 170.35 - other topics like Web Development and Data Science. 173.32 - As a beginner, it's important to explore different areas of programming to determine what you 177.239 - enjoy most. 178.55 - And you will get to do that with this course. 180.55 - But how much do you have to pay for this course? 182.61 - I have seen this course go for 19 dollars on Udemy and it comes with a 30 day money 186.599 - back guarantee. 187.64 - You can always check this course out and get your money back if you don\u2019t like it. 193.799 - Once you have learnt programming, most of you might want to get paid to write code. 204.56 - One of the ways to make good money is to get a job as a programmer at a tech company. 208.69 - In order to do that, you have to go through coding interviews. 211.63 - And the questions asked in these coding interviews are very different from the skills you have 214.659 - learnt so far. 215.94 - Most of these questions are based on this one very famous course called Data Structures 219.05 - and Algorithms or DSA which is taught at most universities. 222.78 - Some people watching this video do not have a computer science degree like me. 226.269 - Many simply did not understand DSA well enough in college. 228.709 - For those people, we have this course called Algorithms by Princeton university. 233.129 - This course is divided into two parts and taught using Java. 236.659 - Professor Sedgewick, who is one of the instructors of this course, has been teaching Algorithms 240.3 - since the 1980s. 241.67 - He has even invented a few algorithms himself. 244.379 - The instructors of this course have seen many algorithms come and go during their careers. 248.489 - Their book on Algorithms has been a bestseller since the 1980s. 254.59 - This course covers a wide range of topics like sorting, searching, graph algorithms, 258.709 - dynamic programming, and more. 260.33 - Rather than focusing on specific algorithms in isolation, this course covers the fundamental 264.88 - concepts and techniques that make the basis of many important algorithms. 268.71 - This helps students to build a deep understanding of the subject that can be applied to a wide 272.44 - range of problems in the interviews. 274.16 - That\u2019s what makes this course the best course on Data Structures and Algorithms. 278.19 - DSA requires a good understanding of Math which many of you might not have. 283.86 - Additionally, the DSA path gets you hired for generic positions and many people want 288.53 - to work in specialized jobs. 289.889 - One of the most popular specializations that has a very high demand is Web development. 294.69 - The biggest issue with learning web development is that this path is very long and most people 298.72 - lose track as they try to learn web development in an unstructured way. 302.66 - To solve this problem, I recommend Meta\u2019s Front end developer professional certificate 306.87 - on Coursera. 307.87 - If you want the certificate, it will cost you around 270 US dollars. 311.88 - But there is an option to audit the courses and get them for free if you don\u2019t care 315.93 - about the certificate. 317.19 - So why do I recommend this course? 319.03 - Well, the course is taught by the Meta staff who work in the industry and have a good understanding 323.34 - of the skills the tech industry is looking for. 325.69 - Meta is also the creator of React which is the most popular and the most in demand front 329.88 - end development library. 330.88 - So, you\u2019ll learn the best practices in React through this course. 333.72 - This course is extremely comprehensive and covers everything you need to get an entry 337.09 - level job as a front end developer. 338.94 - It teaches the basics like HTML, CSS and Javascript. 342.199 - It also covers Bootstrap which is a very popular CSS framework. 345.22 - We already discussed React which is a popular Javascript library. 348.6 - You will also learn the basics of UI and UX design with Figma. 352.0 - The course ends with a separate section on Coding Interview preparation which is a must 355.28 - to land a job. 356.28 - I will link this course in the description. 359.78 - Everything that we have discussed so far can only get you to the level of junior developer. 364.28 - And there\u2019s a big gap between a junior and a senior developer. 366.99 - That\u2019s because a junior developer can simply write and push code for the bug that is assigned 371.21 - to them. 372.21 - But a senior developer has to make sure that the systems this code gets deployed to do 375.5 - not break down if this code is buggy. 378.289 - Additionally, they also need to ensure that the architecture of this system is designed 380.94 - in a way that it can handle a large number of user requests with low latency. 385.069 - Once again, let's turn to Professor Malan to help us understand how it's done. 389.08 - Now this one is not a full course per se, it\u2019s just an introductory video on how to 392.93 - think about scalability. 394.4 - But it\u2019s a great starting point because System Design can be quite overwhelming for 397.759 - some people. 398.759 - This video covers basics like horizontal scaling, load balancing and scaling. 402.389 - It also covers slight advanced concepts like data partitioning and security. 406.16 - If you are curious about what exactly happens in the time between you type a url and the 409.699 - website loads, you should definitely watch this course. 412.49 - Now you know all the different courses you can take to streamline your programming journey. 416.38 - But you still don\u2019t know how to pick a roadmap that is personalized for your background. 419.98 - If you want me to help you with that, watch this video. 422.94 - My name is Sahil and I will see you in the next one."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction and the Wall of Shame 0:10 - Why Many Online Courses Fail 0:44 - CS50: Harvard's Introduction to Programming 2:11 - 100 Days of Code: Staying Consistent 3:24 - Algorithms by Princeton University 4:43 - Specializing in Web Development: Meta's Certificate 5:56 - Transitioning from Junior to Senior Developer 6:29 - System Design Basics with Professor Malan 6:52 - Choosing the Right Roadmap for Your Journey 7:04 - Conclusion and Next Steps"}]}

But that's not going to stop us from trying! 34.12 - The word 'psychology' comes from the Latin for the \"study of the soul.\" And while its 38.6 - formal definition has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call 43.03 - it the science of behavior and mental processes. The term 'psychology' wasn't coined until 48.11 - around the turn of the sixteenth century, and the practice that we would actually call 51.63 - science today wasn't established until the mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always 56.56 - been curious about themselves and what's going on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of 61.29 - human consciousness and decided that it was in the heart, not the head -- being, as we 65.76 - have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course, absolutely and completely wrong. 69.74 - Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted the world's first psychological exams, requiring 74.83 - public officials to take personality and intelligence tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor 79.04 - Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes, also known as Rhazes, was one of the first to describe 83.69 - mental illness, and even treated patients in what was essentially a very early psych 88.89 - ward in his Baghdad hospital. 90.36 - From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been 94.2 - all about tackling some of the big questions: How can humans do horrible things like commit 98.96 - genocide and torture other humans, and how come we know those things are horrible? Do 102.98 - we have free will, or are we simply driven by our environment, biology, and non-conscious 107.31 - influences? What is mental illness, and what can we do about it? And what is consciousness? 112.84 - Or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness of myself, am I still human? 117.12 - I DON'T KNOW! 118.12 - But over the next 6 months, these are the questions that we're gonna be exploring together: 121.69 - how our brains work, how they can break, how they can be healed, why we behave the way 125.659 - we do, even when we don't want to, and what it means to be thinking and feeling and alive. 136.139 - [Intro] 141.459 - When hearing the word psychology, most people probably think of a therapist listening to 145.29 - a patient unpacking the details of his day while reclining on a couch. Maybe that therapist 149.68 - is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking his whiskered chin. 153.12 - Admit it! If you're thinking about psychology, you're probably picturing Freud. 157.269 - Sigmund Freud was one of the most tremendously influential and controversial thinkers of 160.689 - his time, maybe of all time. His theories helped build our views on childhood, personality, 166.049 - dreams and sexuality. And his work fueled a legacy of both support and opposition. 170.92 - His life was long and spanned an important swath of history from the American Civil War 174.59 - to World War II. But like most great scientists, Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by 178.809 - building on the work of others, and of course innovation in the field didn't stop with him. 182.68 - In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly diverse sciences in terms of the questions 187.319 - it proposes, the methods it applies, and the different schools of thought and disciplines 191.59 - it contains. 192.59 - Perhaps more than any other science, psychology is just a big old integrated melting pot. 196.87 - For instance, right around Freud's time, there were a lot of different schools of thought 200.78 - of about how the study of the human mind should be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of 205.51 - structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis. 208.76 - Scientific psychology got its start in 1879 in Germany when physician Wilhelm Wundt set 214.319 - up the first psychology laboratory at the University of Leipzig just a few years after 218.529 - publishing his Principles of Physiological Psychology, considered the first true psychology 224.239 - textbook. 225.239 - Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchener took cues from chemists and physicists and 229.839 - argued that if those people could break down all matter into simple elements or structures, 234.559 - why couldn't they do the same for the brain? 236.92 - They tried to understand the structures of consciousness by getting patients to look 241.529 - inward, asking them how they felt when they watched the sun set, or smelled a coffee, 246.03 - or licked a kitten, or whatever. 247.34 - Titchener named this approach 'structuralism', but despite its rigid sounding name, it really 251.979 - relied so much on introspection that it became too subjective. I mean, you may sense and 256.82 - feel something different that I do, even if we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of 260.81 - course, can't actually observe a patient's inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately, 265.12 - the structuralist school of thought was fairly short-lived. 267.87 - By contrast, American physician and philosopher William James proposed a different set of 272.54 - questions, focusing on why we think and feel and smell and lick, or whatever. Basically, 278.58 - he focused on the function of behavior. This approach, 'functionalism', was based on Charles 283.09 - Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are conserved throughout the evolutionary process. 287.57 - James published his seminal book, The Principles of Psychology, in 1890, defining psychology 292.84 - as the science of mental life, just as Freud was starting to flex his big brain. 298.55 - Sigmund Freud began his medical career at a Viennese hospital, but in 1886, he started 302.94 - his own practice, specializing in nervous disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed 307.71 - his colleague Josef Breuer treat a patient called Anna O with a new talking cure. Basically, 313.22 - he just let her talk about her symptoms. The more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories, 318.25 - the more her symptoms were reduced. It was a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever. 323.59 - From then on, Freud encouraged his patients to talk freely about whatever came to mind, 328.16 - to free associate. This technique provided the basis for his career, and an entire branch 333.43 - of psychology. 334.43 - In 1900 he published his book The Interpretation of Dreams, where he introduced his theory 339.89 - of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think of psychoanalysis as a treatment -- the whole 344.19 - patient on the couch scenario. And that's definitely part of it. But Freud's concept 348.31 - was actually a lot more complex than that, and it was revolutionary. 352.15 - A radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the theory that our personalities are shaped by 357.59 - unconscious motives. Basically Freud suggested that we're all profoundly affected by mental 362.95 - processes that we're not even aware of. 365.04 - Now that sounds almost obvious to us now, but part of the genius of Freud's theory was 369.91 - that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The idea that our minds could be driven by something 374.78 - that our minds themselves didn't know about was hard to grasp. As hard as like, uhh, maybe 380.051 - organisms evolving by natural selection. It was abstract, invisible, and there was something 385.4 - about it that seemed irrational. 386.65 - But the other important part of Freud's theory was that the unconscious, literally the thing 390.561 - below consciousness, was still discoverable. Even though you weren't aware of it, you could 395.59 - come to understand it through a therapeutic technique that used dreams, projections and 399.94 - free association to root out repressed feelings and and gain self-insight. 404.39 - So what Freud was really saying was that mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy 408.98 - and self-discovery. And this was a really big breakthrough. Because prior to this, people 414.23 - with mental illnesses would be confined to sanatoriums and at best given menial labor 418.8 - to do and at worst, shackled to a bed frame. 421.73 - After The Interpretations of Dreams, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books and 425.99 - countless papers with an iconic cigar in hand all the while. He believed smoking helped 430.51 - him think, but it also helped him get jaw cancer. During the last sixteen years of his 434.682 - life, he underwent at least thirty painful operations while continuing to smoke. 439.12 - By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over Austria, and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly 444.21 - escaped to England. By September 1939, the pain in his cancerous jaw was too great and 449.77 - a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through morphine injection. He was eighty-three. 454.3 - Whether you love him or hate him - and make no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed 458.88 - with him - there is no question that Freud's impact on psychology was monumental. While 463.44 - competing theories in the young field of psychology either fell away or evolved into something 467.49 - else, psychoanalysis remains an important concept and practice today. 471.92 - The next big shake-up rolled in during the first half of the 20th century when behaviorism 475.51 - gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner 480.28 - were key players here. They focused on the study of observable behavior. You may remember 485.3 - Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons and babies in boxes and conditioned them to 490.51 - perform certain behaviors. Right around when Freud escaped to England, Skinner published 494.84 - his Behavior of Organisms, ushering in the era of behaviorism which remained all the 499.73 - rage well into the 1960s. 501.48 - The other major force at the time was, of course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many 505.43 - descendents collectively known as the psychodynamic theories. These focused on the importance 510.6 - of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness and how that process affects our thoughts, 515.879 - feelings, behaviors, and personalities. 517.789 - By the mid-20th century, other major forces in psychology were also brewing -- schools 521.93 - we'll explore later in this course including humanist psychology, which focuses on nurturing 526.68 - personal growth; cognitive science and neuroscience, all of which contributed their own unique 531.499 - takes on the study of mind. 533.139 - Today's formal definition of psychology, the study of behavior and mental processes, is 537.66 - a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these different schools of thought. It recognizes 542.069 - the need for observing and recording behavior, whether that's screaming, crying or playing 546.35 - air saxophone to an imaginary audience, but it also gives credit to our mental processes: 551.5 - what we think and feel and believe while we're tearing it up on our invisible instruments. 555.56 - Because again, the point I really want you to take home is that psychology is an integrative 560.309 - science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree plenty, but the essence of the discipline 564.85 - has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions and attempting 569.37 - to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering methods. The human mind is complicated.

in this video let's learn how to use the 1.86 - script in only 15 minutes clock sticking 4.86 - so let's jump into it 7.16 - all right so we're inside the script 9.36 - first thing we're going to do is I'm 10.62 - going to make a new project so we're 11.639 - going to click new project don't worry 12.9 - about new classic project it's going to 14.88 - ask you what kind of project you want to 16.02 - make and you can always change this 17.46 - after you make it but is your project 18.72 - going to be a video based project or an 20.76 - audio based project so we're going to 22.199 - select video project 24.42 - click done and now we're inside the 27.06 - scripts and we've got our interface up 28.92 - so let's go over what each thing does so 30.359 - you can get a brief overview of how this 31.74 - all works and how it all plays together 32.88 - so inside here we can see we've got our 35.7 - composition which basically acts like a 37.98 - tech stock up here we can't see anything 39.719 - because we don't have any videos loaded 41.04 - but this is where our video playback 42.42 - would be over on the left side is going 44.579 - to be where our scene thumbnails are 46.2 - going to be and we'll go over that a 47.399 - little bit later and then over on the 49.02 - right side it's empty because nothing's 50.7 - selected but that's where our settings 52.02 - will be if we need to adjust a clip up 54.239 - here on the top is going to be our 56.1 - different options so we've got our media 58.32 - as it's going to be where all of our 59.52 - media files are going to be our videos 60.96 - photos audio over here if you want to 63.3 - record something new we can record 65.7 - directly this is going to be if we want 68.1 - to add some text inside our composition 70.08 - but honestly it's a lot easier just to 71.82 - do it directly inside the composition 73.08 - the shape button is if we want to add 75.299 - some shapes inside our video and then 77.82 - lastly we've got our template option and 79.92 - this is going to be where we can apply 82.56 - custom templates to scenes which we'll 85.38 - go over a little bit later so easiest 87.0 - way to figure this all out let's just 88.259 - import some video files that's the best 90.18 - way to learn how this works but let's 91.74 - just say I want to upload a file and now 94.439 - it's going to add this file and then 95.34 - it's also going to upload this file to 96.9 - descript server in the background so I 98.46 - can access this on any other computer or 100.68 - share with the team in any location 102.96 - and then if I just either click add or 105.9 - just drag and drop this file over here 108.06 - you can see that it's going to add it to 111.119 - the spot and if you drop it in that 113.1 - purple box or if you drop it here it's 114.659 - going to automatically start 115.619 - transcribing the file you can go into 117.659 - settings if you don't want it to 118.68 - transcribe every single file maybe you 120.78 - had the file transcribed somewhere else 122.52 - and you want to import it which we'll go 124.02 - over in a future video but by default 125.939 - it's going to automatically transcribe 127.68 - your files and then this window will pop 130.08 - up where you can select what language 131.28 - your file is in and how many speakers it 134.04 - has if you're not sure you could also 135.78 - say unsure and it will try to detect the 138.84 - speaker names but for right now since 141.3 - this is a new project uh no we don't 143.76 - have any speaker names loaded now we've 145.44 - got our video loaded one thing we could 146.94 - also do is we come up here to the top 148.2 - left we can change our settings so by 149.94 - default it'll use whatever settings your 151.379 - video is at but let's say we wanted to 152.959 - reframe this or create a social media 155.58 - video Tick Tock video we can come over 157.2 - here select portrait and if we just tap 159.66 - our video and come over to layout and 164.099 - come over to the width and height and we 166.08 - could just scale this video all the way 168.42 - up I'm just going to undo that for this 171.06 - case we've got our video loaded in it 173.7 - automatically transcribes it and as you 175.62 - can see it basically has turned our 177.06 - video into a text document so now to 179.04 - edit this video it is as easy as editing 181.739 - a text document so if I click anywhere 184.08 - and I can either press the space bar or 185.94 - if I hold down the option button and 187.14 - click it will have gpt's paid tier start 190.019 - playing and James Clear 193.739 - so also one thing you'll notice is this 195.72 - new thing pops up on the bottom so this 197.22 - is a timeline and I'll talk about this a 198.78 - little bit later but it is basically a 200.4 - real-time playback of wherever our 202.8 - cursor is in the script during this is a 206.459 - visual timeline representation of all of 208.68 - the video clips and moments and you 210.54 - could also see that it shows a rough 213.78 - version of the transcript down here this 216.06 - is going to come into play if you need 217.08 - to do more finely detailed edits but for 219.48 - right now we don't need to worry about 220.379 - the timeline we're just going to focus 222.0 - on the text part so in this part you can 224.879 - review your text and you can run through 226.5 - it and proofread it if you need to so 228.72 - like over here Chachi PT I'm talking 231.42 - about chat gbt but it writes it out as 233.76 - two words and sort of spells out chat 235.379 - GPT so if you need to make a correction 237.299 - as you're reviewing through your 238.92 - transcript you just highlight the text 240.599 - and then you just click correct and then 242.22 - you just type out 243.48 - the new word 245.519 - so you could run through your transcript 246.86 - proofread it I'd say if you were just 249.42 - editing this video for yourself this is 251.34 - just for your reference you don't really 252.36 - need to have a proofread transcript but 254.879 - I would advise doing a final pass if you 256.979 - want to once you publish your video so 258.78 - that you can export the transcript as 260.94 - captions and upload the captions to 262.56 - YouTube or wherever you embed this video 264.18 - for accessibility reasons and in that 266.28 - case after you Whittle this down it 267.96 - would be good to do a pass and adjust 270.18 - your transcripts now let's talk about 272.04 - editing our video slash text let's say I 275.28 - just want to cut out this line so if we 277.44 - play this Joey Dowd each week twice a 280.32 - week we send out video signals a new and 282.9 - I just want to go 284.58 - straight to so let's jump into I'm Joey 287.88 - Dao let's jump into the five links so if 289.56 - I highlight this text 291.84 - and I just press delete 295.86 - you'll see there's a little icon here 297.419 - that indicates that there's a cut in the 299.1 - video this little dashed vertical line 300.78 - so now if I hit play this back everyone 302.1 - I am Joey Dowd so let's jump into the 305.759 - five links it automatically made that 307.68 - edit for me I didn't have to like mess 309.479 - with any video timelines or anything I 311.22 - just adjusted the text and it 312.84 - automatically made the cut and that's 314.639 - pretty much the Riff of what you would 316.56 - do with this you would just run through 318.419 - this adjust your text and make all of 321.96 - the edits that you want to make and I'm 323.759 - just on one video clip you could add as 326.039 - many video clips as you want and you can 328.56 - pull whatever excerpts or sound bites 330.96 - you want from those video clips and mix 333.24 - and match incorporate them inside the 335.16 - script and it will automatically edit 337.08 - that video in real time so in this 338.82 - example from a video we did about James 341.039 - clear's newsletter we were pulling from 343.74 - multiple podcast sources and then I was 346.919 - writing out inside the script you could 348.96 - just write out text and we'll cover in a 351.0 - different video but you could also turn 352.38 - this text into AI voice text but in this 355.44 - case this was to write out a script and 356.94 - incorporate it with podcast clips that 359.1 - we had so you can see here in the 360.84 - beginning we have scripted part for an 363.36 - intro line and then multiple video files 365.94 - being pulled and then multiple lines 368.039 - from different videos all edited into 369.9 - this one composition this one video so 371.699 - if we click over here we can see that 373.62 - this project has multiple compositions 377.1 - so in one case we downloaded different 378.9 - clips from CBS News how to transcribed 381.12 - and then let's say I just want to use 383.819 - this section I can just highlight this 385.44 - text 386.639 - copy it come back over to my main 390.12 - project 391.38 - let's say I want to add it after this 393.66 - Tim Ferriss clip if I just press enter 396.36 - add a new line 397.979 - and paste it 400.199 - it automatically pulls that extra clip 402.12 - in adds it in here and I'm able to edit 404.759 - with multiple video clips by simply 407.22 - copying and pasting 409.02 - so when you're editing the script as I 411.24 - noted you can just delete Parts 416.419 - okay so let's say I want to remove that 418.5 - part but let's say for the sake of this 421.44 - video I'm like I don't know maybe I want 423.3 - to bring that back later I don't want to 424.5 - fully delete it I want to remember what 426.0 - was there so if I highlight it instead 428.34 - of pressing delete I can press 430.319 - strikethrough which they call ignore you 432.78 - could also access this by doing command 434.16 - backspace and that will strike this out 436.56 - and so we can see visually here I can 438.84 - still see that this text is here but I 440.58 - can see that it will be ignored so if I 441.84 - play this back 443.099 - at that issue you also get fast response 445.5 - times and it skips it it acts like it's 448.5 - a cut it acts like it's not there but 450.36 - when you're reviewing the script you can 451.56 - still see that that text is there so 452.88 - this is more useful for ideas or like 456.06 - longer sentences or paragraphs where 458.22 - you're like I feel like I need to cut 459.66 - this out for the sake of the video but 462.419 - maybe I'll come back to it or maybe I'll 463.86 - reuse it I don't want to fully delete it 465.539 - and forget about it 467.52 - and by the way nothing is actually 469.38 - deleted this is non-destructive so 472.139 - anything you remove it is still in your 474.72 - Source video file you can still bring it 476.94 - back so let's say we've run through our 478.56 - video we have condensed everything that 481.139 - we want to condense we have all of the 483.24 - spoken word is what we want to say the 485.46 - next step we're going to do is add the 486.9 - visuals and the way we do that into 488.34 - script is we add scenes so scenes are 490.68 - basically a way to think of hey in this 492.66 - section here I want to Mark a start and 494.4 - an endpoint and I want some sort of 496.199 - visual to happen here so when I come in 498.539 - and I drop a b-roll another video clip 500.58 - or a screen recording I just wanted to 502.5 - show up for this section and we're just 504.18 - going to Mark out each section inside 505.919 - our script that we want to have a new 507.72 - visual happen and the way we do that is 509.819 - we add a forward slash so let's jump 512.159 - into another project let's say we're 513.479 - editing this social media clip this Tick 515.64 - Tock video starts off with the intro 518.64 - or stop manually posting social 521.64 - meet with hubbler so I'm going to want 524.279 - to add scenes so with each of these 525.779 - shots I'm going to want to show 526.56 - something different so I'm going to want 527.58 - to make each of them a scene and it's 529.019 - going to get a lot easier to add a 530.58 - visual exactly where I want it to be so 533.04 - I added these returns but I need to add 535.26 - a forward slash if I just type in a 536.64 - forward slash we could see over here on 538.32 - the side it just added a new thumbnail 540.06 - which indicates oh this is a new scene 542.04 - so you can see it's highlighting 543.54 - everything in the rest of the video 544.62 - because that's a scene but if I just 546.3 - come over here to this next line 548.16 - at a forward slash new scene and so now 550.56 - if I click on two this line of text is a 553.62 - scene 554.7 - first line 558.42 - this is the scene and then I want to add 560.82 - another scene here and I could add a 562.2 - forward slash or also I could just click 563.76 - this slash button if you don't want to 565.14 - use keyboard shortcuts for whatever 567.12 - reason 568.32 - so let's say I want to show a visual and 570.24 - let's say maybe I want to use like I 571.68 - don't know some stock footage so if I 572.82 - just come over here to Media 574.38 - we can see I have all the files that I 576.0 - imported but if we come over here we can 577.8 - see that these are freely available 579.779 - stock footage clips that I can use 584.519 - and you could search so let's say I just 586.56 - want something that is let's see what 588.24 - social media pops up with 593.76 - cool some flying through social media 595.68 - icons so if I just click this 599.76 - it will download it 603.18 - and you can see it just highlighted this 604.92 - whole little section that I marked as a 606.36 - scene and down here in the timeline it 609.0 - marked over this scene section hey this 611.399 - is the video that we're displaying over 613.2 - this entire section and now I'm going to 614.94 - want to click on it and scale this up so 619.14 - it fills the entire frame 624.36 - and now if I play back we can see scene 626.279 - one still remains unchanged 633.38 - and now we've got our video 638.459 - and then we go back to our regular shot 641.399 - and so you could just run through this 642.959 - and apply any visual you want to any 645.0 - starts and then whatever section you 646.98 - just marked out now I just mentioned 648.839 - that yes you could grab stock video from 651.18 - here but also you can get stock images 653.399 - stock gifs you can get stock backgrounds 656.339 - music sound effects so there are tons of 659.22 - free tools and resources already built 661.32 - into descript that you can pull in and 663.959 - add to your projects now let's talk 666.18 - about another Time Saver templates all 668.76 - right so if you come over the templates 670.019 - and let's say we just add this vertical 671.94 - template 673.8 - style might not be the best but 679.68 - it saves you time you can see this 681.24 - bottom part uses Dynamic captions which 683.399 - shows whatever we transcribed here in 686.339 - real time 687.48 - now the style and not be fit for you but 690.0 - what is useful is if you build out your 692.82 - own custom looks either using the shapes 695.82 - from over here 698.279 - or text features or 702.54 - other templates if you just right click 705.06 - on the scene you can save this template 707.579 - to be your own custom template so that 709.68 - you can use it in the future like some 712.32 - of these templates that we have here and 714.779 - lastly let's talk about the timeline the 717.0 - timeline you'll need to use if you need 718.8 - to fine tune your edits a bit more or if 721.079 - you need to cut out moments of Silence 722.7 - in the video or if you want to show 725.459 - Media across multiple scenes or have a 727.68 - bit more control over it you're going to 729.12 - need to use the timeline now real quick 730.98 - let's jump into a project that is a bit 733.92 - more polished and completed so we can 736.079 - see here has a bunch of scenes a lot 738.48 - more scenes a lot more visuals added so 740.459 - easy enough to Mark out a scene drop in 742.26 - a visual and also drop in different 744.54 - screen recordings so if we stretch up 747.06 - this timeline like I said before this is 748.62 - a visual representation also if you've 750.899 - used any other video editing tools this 752.579 - is a more classical view of how you 754.92 - would edit your video so if we expand 757.44 - the timeline view we can see all of the 759.899 - layers here and these layers correspond 761.579 - to all of the layer layers inside our 763.98 - video and so if we want to manually 766.86 - adjust let's say we need the background 768.36 - to display longer than a scene we can 771.0 - just grab the layer of the background 772.8 - and drag it across as long as we need to 775.26 - and we can manually adjust how long that 778.32 - background image or whatever image 779.7 - whatever layer you want how long that 781.139 - stays on screen 782.519 - the timeline also comes in handy if you 784.2 - need to fine tune where an edit is made 786.899 - so when we're editing in the document or 789.24 - the word view the script does a pretty 791.22 - good job of matching up the edits of the 793.56 - video to the words but sometimes it 796.68 - might misjudge where a word actually 798.24 - ends in the audio so it might cut off a 800.22 - word or it might leave a little extra 801.72 - Gap after we stop saying the word which 804.3 - we want to trim up so the video is a 805.92 - little bit tighter and cleaner so if we 807.72 - come over here to the end of the clip we 808.92 - can just manually drag the end of the 811.26 - clip and have it end where we need to 813.3 - and we could use the audio waveforms as 815.04 - a guideline to see where we stop 817.079 - speaking and where we want the edit to 819.54 - be now there are a lot of effects and 821.22 - features and we're not going to cover 822.3 - them in this video but the one thing 824.12 - that you will probably want to know how 827.519 - to use and be interested especially if 829.5 - you're doing social media videos is 831.36 - adding Dynamic captions so if we just 833.7 - come over here click the text click add 836.04 - captions we can see that it's 837.839 - highlighted down here with captions 841.8 - and it is showing our captions in real 844.86 - time but it is not the most interesting 846.899 - looking so if we come over here we can 849.24 - change different options like how live 850.68 - text is displayed so if we have a style 853.26 - for the active word to highlight it 861.42 - if we want to change the style of future 863.16 - words 869.459 - and what we want to change the current 870.899 - text to so there's a lot of customizable 872.94 - options here changing the font adding 876.12 - the backgrounds it's more legible adding 878.399 - a border so we can really customize it 879.899 - and customize how it animates so you can 882.06 - see here we now have one word 885.18 - highlighting at a time and then also we 887.579 - could even do things like if you want to 889.139 - display more text at once we could 890.459 - stretch this out and make it bigger or 891.72 - if we want to display only a few words 894.18 - at a time 896.82 - we can make it smaller so it's really 899.279 - flexible and really easy to add animated 902.94 - Dynamic captions to our videos and then 905.04 - once we're done with everything we're 906.06 - going to want to publish it 908.16 - so if we come over here to publish we 910.44 - can either share this composition as a 912.72 - shareable link which is most likely not 915.24 - what you're going to want to do you 916.44 - could also publish directly from 918.18 - descript to most major platforms you 920.699 - could publish it directly to YouTube to 922.68 - buzz Sprout it's got a podcast restream 925.26 - with TSO most major platforms are 927.24 - supported here or if you just want to 929.519 - export the video file you come over to 931.019 - export you can choose if you want to 932.94 - export as a video audio file or if you 934.98 - want to export the transcript you just 936.54 - indicate what section you want to export 938.88 - most likely it's just going to be the 940.079 - current composition everything you see 941.579 - here and that you edited what resolution 943.68 - you want to export it at and it'll also 945.66 - note if your composition was in a 947.519 - different size 949.56 - what kind of quality you want to export 951.12 - it at 952.019 - and some specific audio settings and 954.899 - then if you want to include any metadata 956.279 - like some of the text here and then you 958.38 - just click export and choose where you 960.6 - want to save it and it will export your 961.98 - file and you are good to go and that's 965.76 - it you've exported your video and now 967.68 - you're good to go now we just kind of 969.24 - scratched the surface of what you can do 970.38 - in descript but this should get you up 971.76 - and running but if you have specific 973.32 - questions or things that you're trying 975.06 - to accomplish with the script let us 976.62 - know in the comments below also if you 978.54 - found this video useful please hit the 980.339 - Subscribe button and give this video a 982.019 - thumbs up thanks for watching I'll catch 984.06 - you in the next video"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

And that includes us,\u00a0\u00a0 4.08 - by the way, at Semrush Academy in this YouTube\u00a0 channel. Guilty as charged, but in this video,\u00a0\u00a0 8.36 - I am going to make sense of this very confusing\u00a0 landscape and share with you the most important\u00a0\u00a0 12.88 - marketing certifications, the free ones that\u00a0 will help you upgrade your skillset and also\u00a0\u00a0 18.12 - pad your CV with shiny, impressive credentials. No judgment. We all do it. And in the end,\u00a0\u00a0 22.96 - I will share the most useful marketing\u00a0 certification I have ever received. Honestly,\u00a0\u00a0 26.8 - it was a complete game changer for my career, and\u00a0 I'm pretty sure it'll be for yours too. First,\u00a0\u00a0 34.44 - let's break down the landscape of free\u00a0 online learning so you understand what\u00a0\u00a0 38.36 - courses are out there and where to find them. First, we have MOOCs. MOOC stands for Massive\u00a0\u00a0 45.24 - Open Online Course. These are the courses\u00a0 that show up in websites like Coursera,\u00a0\u00a0 50.28 - edX, Udemy, or FutureLearn. Now, when MOOCs\u00a0 were born back in 2008, it was amazing! Suddenly,\u00a0\u00a0 57.36 - you could take a Stanford, MIT, or even a\u00a0 Harvard course for free. And you could get a\u00a0\u00a0 62.12 - university level education without an entrance\u00a0 exam or any of these fraternity initiations.\u00a0 67.4 - If you know what I mean. Hi. Sadly, those days are long gone. Today,\u00a0\u00a0 75.6 - you have to pay to enroll in a large number\u00a0 of MOOCs, but there are some that are still\u00a0\u00a0 80.68 - free and here is how to find them. Now, what\u00a0 I like to do is go on Coursera, for example,\u00a0\u00a0 85.44 - and search for free courses with certificate. Then\u00a0 I sort these courses to only see business courses,\u00a0\u00a0 91.56 - which includes topics related to digital\u00a0 marketing, which is the purpose of this video.\u00a0 95.72 - Now this list is nice enough, but unfortunately,\u00a0 It cannot be trusted. You actually have to go one\u00a0\u00a0 101.88 - by one to confirm that these are actually free.\u00a0 Like this course right here on Google ads for\u00a0\u00a0 106.56 - beginners is free and it comes with a shareable\u00a0 certificate. That's amazing. But this other one\u00a0\u00a0 112.0 - on food and beverage management from Bocconi\u00a0 University in Milan is unfortunately not free.\u00a0 117.88 - Usually you can tell because Coursera tells\u00a0 you that there is financial aid available.\u00a0\u00a0 122.16 - And then when you click on enroll, It'll\u00a0 also give you the price for the course.\u00a0\u00a0 126.24 - Huge bummer. But that's MOOCs for you. There\u00a0 are so many out there, but actually finding\u00a0\u00a0 130.72 - the right free option might not be super simple. Just takes a ton of trial and error. Now in that\u00a0\u00a0 136.56 - initial Coursera page, maybe you noticed that some\u00a0 courses were built by universities, but others\u00a0\u00a0 141.72 - were created by companies like Google or Intuit.\u00a0 These are known as professional certifications.\u00a0\u00a0 147.64 - These are credentials that are handed out\u00a0 usually by industry giants that validate\u00a0\u00a0 151.48 - your skills in a particular field or tool. It's kind of like a university degree in the sense\u00a0\u00a0 156.8 - that they give you credibility when you're looking\u00a0 for a job, but unlike many university degrees,\u00a0\u00a0 161.56 - which tend to focus on the theoretical parts of\u00a0 marketing, like marketing. Stuff like the four Ps,\u00a0\u00a0 166.16 - professional certifications get you into some\u00a0 of the world's most popular marketing tools.\u00a0 171.16 - Like the kind of stuff that you will be using\u00a0 in a marketing job on a day to day basis. If\u00a0\u00a0 175.32 - you're looking to learn about a specific tool, I\u00a0 suggest that you go directly to the tools website\u00a0\u00a0 180.28 - to research whether they have a certification\u00a0 or an academy. Those courses are usually for the\u00a0\u00a0 185.0 - most part free since tech companies want\u00a0 you to learn how to use their products.\u00a0 189.16 - It's really good for business, you know,\u00a0 like I would love for you to become a Semrush blackbelt. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 193.96 - when it comes to professional certifications,\u00a0 there are two companies that invest the most,\u00a0\u00a0 197.96 - Google and Meta. Google offers a range of\u00a0 professional certifications through Google\u00a0\u00a0 202.6 - Skill Shop. These courses cover everything\u00a0 from the basics of digital marketing to\u00a0\u00a0 207.28 - more advanced topics like Google Analytics. The Fundamentals of\u00a0\u00a0 210.76 - Digital Marketing course is honestly a super solid\u00a0 intro. It's 40 hours, which is a big investment,\u00a0\u00a0 216.36 - but if you've never worked in marketing and you\u00a0 want to start, this is a great choice. You will\u00a0\u00a0 220.48 - learn the why of SEO, PPC, paid social,\u00a0 all of that. All the good industry jargon\u00a0\u00a0 225.6 - that you will encounter in any marketing job. Now, Google courses also come with an actual\u00a0\u00a0 230.44 - certificate of completion, which is great.\u00a0 If you're trying to learn specific social\u00a0\u00a0 234.48 - media advertising tools, though, I would shift\u00a0 away from Google and focus on Meta. Meta offers\u00a0\u00a0 239.2 - certification courses on their core products, like\u00a0 Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, And even WhatsApp,\u00a0\u00a0 244.92 - because yes, you can advertise on WhatsApp. Now, while Meta offers lots of free courses\u00a0\u00a0 250.04 - for all their tools, they offer six different\u00a0 certifications from beginner to advanced. You\u00a0\u00a0 255.88 - can prepare for these certifications with free\u00a0 courses, study guides, and practice tests,\u00a0\u00a0 261.24 - but to register for the actual exam costs between\u00a0 100 and 150 dollars. So if you are looking to prove your\u00a0\u00a0 267.84 - expertise to help you get a job, then it might be\u00a0 worth considering paying for the certification.\u00a0 273.04 - But if you're only looking to improve your\u00a0 skills, the free courses should be more than\u00a0\u00a0 277.28 - enough. Finally, another place that you can\u00a0 go to learn for free is LinkedIn Learning,\u00a0\u00a0 282.52 - which is uh, formerly known as lynda. com.\u00a0 LinkedIn Learning offers courses on a super,\u00a0\u00a0 287.64 - super wide range of topics from leadership\u00a0 development to advanced storytelling.\u00a0 291.76 - Please note that you will need a LinkedIn premium\u00a0 account to access this content, but I'm including\u00a0\u00a0 297.32 - LinkedIn learning in this list because the first\u00a0 month is free. So if you're a quick learner,\u00a0\u00a0 301.52 - you'll be able to learn a lot in that time.\u00a0 You can play all the videos at double speed,\u00a0\u00a0 305.96 - which is what I do most of the time. Now that you know what Free marketing\u00a0\u00a0 309.16 - courses are out there. Let's talk a little\u00a0 bit about how you decide which one you should\u00a0\u00a0 313.6 - take. My recommendation before you enroll is\u00a0 that you think about your career objective\u00a0\u00a0 318.76 - and your skill level even better identify a\u00a0 job you'd love to have, and then make a plan\u00a0\u00a0 323.96 - for the types of certifications that can prove\u00a0 that you have the right skills to get that job.\u00a0 329.2 - Say you would like to apply for this analyst job\u00a0 at Duolingo. From looking at the job description,\u00a0\u00a0 334.16 - you might want to look for introductory\u00a0 courses in SQL or in R. Or maybe you want\u00a0\u00a0 338.56 - to be a social media content creator, in which\u00a0 case you might want to take some meta courses\u00a0\u00a0 343.2 - and maybe even pay for the certification. Or you could check out the library of content\u00a0\u00a0 347.32 - strategy courses on Semrush Academy. Our courses\u00a0 are shorter and still come with a certificate so\u00a0\u00a0 352.56 - you can upskill and build credentials quite\u00a0 quickly. Now by considering these factors,\u00a0\u00a0 356.72 - your career goals your current skill level, and\u00a0 the time you have to commit to these courses,\u00a0\u00a0 362.2 - you can start charting the map\u00a0 to your next learning adventure.\u00a0 365.04 - The good old saying, never stop learning is\u00a0 true, but it's equally true that we all have\u00a0\u00a0 369.52 - to start somewhere. Okay, As promised, I\u00a0 will now reveal the course that changed\u00a0\u00a0 374.0 - my career forever. As an undergraduate, I\u00a0 studied French and international relations,\u00a0\u00a0 378.32 - so my background was in letters, not numbers.\u00a0 So when I first started working in marketing,\u00a0\u00a0 383.6 - I felt super intimidated and self-conscious\u00a0 by all the numbers and all the analytics.\u00a0 388.48 - So I decided to become certified in Google\u00a0 Analytics and this really truly helped me\u00a0\u00a0 393.12 - understand how not just web analytics worked,\u00a0 but how digital marketing worked. And it really\u00a0\u00a0 397.76 - pushed me further towards becoming the\u00a0 analytical marketer that I am today. Now,\u00a0\u00a0 401.72 - I would love to hear from you. What is the one\u00a0 skill you're eager to learn in the upcoming year?\u00a0 406.48 - Share it in the comments and we might just\u00a0 create a course about it.

Hi guys, welcome back to the channel. 1.77 - I was recently checking that a lot of people on the channel 4.531 - are watching videos related to courses and resumes. 6.921 - So, I assumed that many freshers might be 8.734 - looking for placements. 10.055 - Or, because of one reason or the other, 11.544 - they might need some courses 13.573 - that might help them boost their resume. 15.563 - So, I thought after looking at all the courses 17.661 - available in the market, 18.607 - I would pick some courses that I found valuable, 21.226 - and that you can easily complete to enhance your resume. 24.225 - So, let me share 5 such courses. 25.991 - And it might happen that 27.237 - some of these courses are paid. 28.859 - How you can add them to your resume for free, 31.323 - I will also explain that towards the end of the video. 33.551 - So, let me start with the first one, 35.008 - which is the IIM Ahmedabad online courses. 37.488 - IIM Ahmedabad has an online portal called \"Online@IIMA.\" 40.938 - You can regularly check it yourself as well. 42.973 - There are many such free courses available here 45.0 - that anyone can take up. 46.563 - At the moment, there are 3 such good courses available 48.605 - that I wanted to share with you. 49.964 - The first is called 'Pre-MBA Statistics' 52.123 - and 'Pre-MBA Accounting'. 53.929 - These are two separate courses. 55.237 - Anyone who wants to enter the field of MBA, 57.421 - or in general, if you want to learn the basics 58.971 - of statistics or accounting, 60.458 - then these are 2 courses that you can take up. 62.214 - The second course is on Leadership Skills. 64.145 - It will teach you very simple basic management skills, 67.214 - so I think this is another one that you can take up. 69.126 - And the third one is 'Analytics for Business Problem Solving'. 72.194 - I particularly like this course because, 74.307 - firstly, the insights it offers are excellent. 76.173 - Secondly, this point will look very strong on your resume. 79.009 - So, I think these are a couple of courses 80.895 - from IIM Ahmedabad's portal that you can take up. 83.14 - The second course is from IBM. 85.423 - They have a website called 'SkillsBuild', 87.51 - where many courses are available and they are all free. 89.75 - Recently, IBM reached out to me 91.806 - to share about these courses on Instagram, 93.969 - but I thought I'll explain them in this YouTube video. 96.0 - Because I genuinely found them helpful. 97.719 - There are many courses related to AI on this platform. 100.108 - 3 courses are specifically mentioned on their platform. 102.452 - All three of these courses can be completed within an hour. 105.46 - They are very basic and you don't need any prior knowledge. 108.365 - You also get a digital sticker, as they call it. 111.167 - So, I think due to these three factors, 112.653 - if you want to bring a bit of an AI angle to your resume, 115.356 - then this can also help you. 116.654 - There\u2019s another course related to AI, 118.062 - which is the third recommendation by Google. 120.3 - This particular course is hosted on Coursera, 122.798 - and it's called 'Google AI Essentials'. 125.142 - You can complete this course in a total of 10 hours. 128.133 - It\u2019s suitable for anyone who wants to do their daily tasks, 131.885 - any work-related activities, 133.598 -  or even wants to integrate AI into their academics. 136.649 - It teaches you how to use the tools that Google offers. 139.264 - One of the things that I really liked about this course 141.149 - is that it has a very high rating. 143.028 - Plus, the feedback on various platforms like Reddit 144.673 - and AllPay was also very positive. 146.445 - So, I thought I would share this. 147.605 - If anyone especially wants to enter the tech or AI field. 150.87 - All the courses I've mentioned so far 152.606 - are either related to the field of management  154.647 - or about how to use AI to manage your daily tasks. 158.455 - There is also a free tool  159.878 - called 'Project Management' by Odoo. 162.0 - This first app is free forever, 163.614 - so you don\u2019t have to pay upfront. 164.892 - You simply need to sign up, 166.154 - and you can access it from either your laptop or phone. 169.203 - If you want to make your daily tasks easier 171.513 - or even learn practical project management, 173.846 - then you can use this. 174.852 - It offers various views, like the 'Kanban' view, 177.071 - which displays all tasks as cards, 179.279 - the 'Gantt' view, which provides an overview of 181.241 - who is working on what, and the 'List' view, 183.169 - which displays tasks in a list format, 184.614 - allowing you to do batch changes. 186.299 - In this tool, you can add any task 187.951 - and even define its stages. 189.384 - You can track the time it takes to complete a task 192.747 - and change its status as needed. 194.257 - You can also move tasks through different stages 196.217 -  to monitor your progress. 197.288 - For example, I created a project for MBA aspirants, 199.887 - where you can monitor your CAT preparation progress. 202.994 - And in the same way, you can use this tool 204.339 - for various types of analysis, as it offers many options. 207.0 - So, I am going to add the link 208.483 - in the pinned comment and description. 210.0 - You can simply check it out. 211.154 - Now, let's move on to our 4th course. 213.0 - This 4th course is by ISB, 214.64 - and it's called Beginner\u2019s Guide to Investing. 216.745 - Now, why have I included this course? 218.428 - Because I have been personally pursuing this course, 220.772 - as I also wanted to learn more about investments, 223.047 - the stock market, and the different options available. 225.0 - And personally, I am liking it. 226.253 - So, I was like, I will share it. 227.454 - Not only will it add value to your resume, 229.577 - but if you want to make investments 230.891 - in your personal life as well, 232.174 - then that is also going to help you. 233.503 - There are two more special things about this course. 235.069 - First, you can complete it in just 7 hours, 237.182 - so it's quite a short course. 238.418 - I completed it within a week 240.493 - by spending around 1-2 hours per day. 242.586 - Secondly, it's very relatable 244.309 - because it is taught by ISB professors, 246.241 - so in the Indian context, it is very easy to understand. 248.819 - The final course recommendation, which I feel will be 251.101 - a value add for anyone in any field, 253.691 - is Udemy's Excel course. 255.705 - This course is called Microsoft Excel: Basics to Advanced. 259.245 - If you just look at its ratings, you will realize 261.634 - how many people across the world 263.214 - have pursued this course. 264.551 - And the reason is that it genuinely covers everything 267.0 - from the basics to advanced topics related to Excel. 270.524 - The price is also quite reasonable, 271.829 - around 500-600 rupees or so, 274.096 - and it covers everything in great depth. 276.546 - So, if you want to take this paid version, 278.817 - you'll have to pay this amount. 279.977 - However, there is a substitute available, 281.455 - which is a free course 282.477 - that is offered in the Hindi language. 284.209 - It\u2019s on a website called LearnVern, 286.138 - where you will find all the topics covered in this course, 289.382 - but in Hindi in that particular course. 291.854 - This is a course that I have frequently recommended 294.0 - on this channel and on my Instagram handle as well 296.418 - because it has helped many people. 298.382 - And Excel is a skill that will definitely come in handy. 301.118 - So, in total, these are the 5 courses 302.892 - that I would recommend. 303.969 - And I\u2019m not saying there are only 5; there could be more. 306.203 - But overall, these are the 5 basic broader categories 308.808 - of courses that you can pursue. 310.517 - Now, let me explain the way 312.216 - that if by chance you are pursuing any course, 314.669 - but it\u2019s not free, 315.665 - can you still add it to your resume if you haven\u2019t paid for it? 319.834 - Absolutely yes. 320.953 - So, what do you mention in your resume? 323.374 - You mention something that is a skill you possess 325.441 - or something that you have done. 326.676 - If you have pursued any course, 328.893 - irrespective of whether you have the certificate or not, 331.513 - you can mention that point. 333.102 - In fact, let me show you a sample 335.041 - if I completed a particular course on Coursera, 337.44 - then how I would present a course. 338.982 - All you basically need to enter is the course name, 341.587 - when you pursued it, and exactly which skills you learned. 345.083 - Now, you may ask why a certificate is necessary. 347.504 - In some organizations, like the IIMs, 350.847 - your resume carries weight, 352.804 - basically, whatever points you have mentioned, 355.041 - you need to tally them with proofs. 357.4 - If, for example, you get admission to that college 359.925 - or someone asks you in a company, 361.837 - in that case, you can always go back to this dashboard 364.952 - where you completed the course, 366.544 - and you can purchase that certificate 368.427 - at that time, if needed. 370.373 - Actually, such a need rarely arises. 372.206 - Usually, what happens is, 373.213 - if you have mentioned any point in your resume, 375.634 - no one asks you to show the certificate. 378.0 - They generally ask you questions about that course 380.752 - or whatever topic you have learned. 382.343 - So, if you can convincingly express 385.255 - what your learnings were and explain to them 388.552 - what exactly you did while pursuing the course, 390.85 - including the assignments you completed 392.087 - and what you learned, that much is going to be sufficient. 394.462 - So, this is broadly what I wanted to share. 396.575 - I hope that doing this will make your resume stronger. 399.195 - If you need any other suggestions regarding anything, 402.107 - just let me know, and I will make that video. 403.884 - Thanks so much for watching, guys. 404.981 - And all the very best!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to Course Recommendations 0:35 -

5.62 - Over the past two episodes, we got our first taste of programming in a high-level language, 10.01 - like Python or Java. 11.39 - We talked about different types of programming language statements \u2013 like assignments, 14.269 - ifs, and loops \u2013 as well as putting statements into functions that perform a computation, 18.67 - like calculating an exponent. 20.33 - Importantly, the function we wrote to calculate exponents is only one possible solution. 24.599 - There are other ways to write this function \u2013 using different statements in different 27.589 - orders \u2013 that achieve exactly the same numerical result. 30.34 - The difference between them is the algorithm, that is the specific steps used to complete 34.44 - the computation. 35.16 - Some algorithms are better than others even if they produce equal results. 38.52 - Generally, the fewer steps it takes to compute, the better it is, though sometimes we care 42.87 - about other factors, like how much memory it uses. 45.42 - The term algorithm comes from Persian polymath Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b who was 49.64 - one of the fathers of algebra more than a millennium ago. 52.329 - The crafting of efficient algorithms \u2013 a problem that existed long before modern computers 56.05 - \u2013 led to a whole science surrounding computation, which evolved into the modern discipline of\u2026 60.84 - you guessed it! 61.84 - Computer Science! 62.76 - INTRO 71.97 - One of the most storied algorithmic problems in all of computer science is sorting\u2026 as 75.781 - in sorting names or sorting numbers. 78.29 - Computers sort all the time. 79.869 - Looking for the cheapest airfare, arranging your email by most recently sent, or scrolling 83.84 - your contacts by last name -- those all require sorting. 87.149 - You might think \u201csorting isn\u2019t so tough\u2026 how many algorithms can there possibly be?\u201d 90.92 - The answer is: a lot. 92.5 - Computer Scientists have spent decades inventing algorithms for sorting, with cool names like 96.18 - Bubble Sort and Spaghetti Sort. 98.31 - Let\u2019s try sorting! 99.78 - Imagine we have a set of airfare prices to Indianapolis. 102.45 - We\u2019ll talk about how data like this is represented in memory next week, but for now, a series 107.439 - of items like this is called an array. 109.56 - Let\u2019s take a look at these numbers to help see how we might sort this programmatically. 112.71 - We\u2019ll start with a simple algorithm. 115.14 - First, let\u2019s scan down the array to find the smallest number. 118.21 - Starting at the top with 307. 119.52 - It\u2019s the only number we\u2019ve seen, so it\u2019s also the smallest. 123.07 - The next is 239, that\u2019s smaller than 307, so it becomes our new smallest number. 129.25 - Next is 214, our new smallest number. 131.95 - 250 is not, neither is 384, 299, 223 or 312. 139.3 - So we\u2019ve finished scanning all numbers, and 214 is the smallest. 142.94 - To put this into ascending order, we swap 214 with the number in the top location. 147.53 - Great. 148.53 - We sorted one number! 149.58 - Now we repeat the same procedure, but instead of starting at the top, we can start one spot 153.31 - below. 154.04 - First we see 239, which we save as our new smallest number. 158.04 - Scanning the rest of the array, we find 223 is the next smallest, so we swap this with 163.28 - the number in the second spot. 164.81 - Now we repeat again, starting from the third number down. 167.88 - This time, we swap 239 with 307. 171.2 - This process continues until we get to the very last number, and voila, the array is 175.831 - sorted and you\u2019re ready to book that flight to Indianapolis! 178.23 - The process we just walked through is one way \u2013 or one algorithm \u2013 for sorting an 182.32 - array. 183.32 - It\u2019s called Selection Sort -- and it\u2019s pretty basic. 185.25 - Here\u2019s the pseudo-code. 186.99 - This function can be used to sort 8, 80, or 80 million numbers - and once you've written 191.55 - the function, you can use it over and over again. 194.15 - With this sort algorithm, we loop through each position in the array, from top to bottom, 197.9 - and then for each of those positions, we have to loop through the array to find the smallest 201.3 - number to swap. 202.4 - You can see this in the code, where one FOR loop is nested inside of another FOR loop. 206.54 - This means, very roughly, that if we want to sort N items, we have to loop N times, 210.95 - inside of which, we loop N times, for a grand total of roughly N times N loops... 215.61 - Or N squared. 216.61 - This relationship of input size to the number of steps the algorithm takes to run characterizes 221.09 - the complexity of the Selection Sort algorithm. 224.13 - It gives you an approximation of how fast, or slow, an algorithm is going to be. 228.4 - Computer Scientists write this order of growth in something known as \u2013 no joke \u2013 \u201cbig 232.91 - O notation\u201d. 233.91 - N squared is not particularly efficient. 236.01 - Our example array had n = 8 items, and 8 squared is 64. 240.44 - If we increase the size of our array from 8 items to 80, the running time is now 80 245.52 - squared, which is 6,400. 247.87 - So although our array only grew by 10 times - from 8 to 80 \u2013 the running time increased 251.86 - by 100 times \u2013 from 64 to 6,400! 256.11 - This effect magnifies as the array gets larger. 258.489 - That\u2019s a big problem for a company like Google, which has to sort arrays with millions 262.61 - or billions of entries. 263.96 - So, you might ask, as a burgeoning computer scientist, is there a more efficient sorting algorithm? 268.78 - Let\u2019s go back to our old, unsorted array and try a different algorithm, merge sort. 273.4 - The first thing merge sort does is check if the size of the array is greater than 1. 276.87 - If it is, it splits the array into two halves. 279.54 - Since our array is size 8, it gets split into two arrays of size 4. 283.08 - These are still bigger than size 1, so they get split again, into arrays of size 2, and 287.569 - finally they split into 8 arrays with 1 item in each. 290.54 - Now we are ready to merge, which is how \u201cmerge sort\u201d gets its name. 293.56 - Starting with the first two arrays, we read the first \u2013 and only \u2013 value in them, 297.02 - in this case, 307 and 239. 300.1 - 239 is smaller, so we take that value first. 303.51 - The only number left is 307, so we put that value second. 307.13 - We\u2019ve successfully merged two arrays. 309.759 - We now repeat this process for the remaining pairs, putting them each in sorted order. 313.61 - Then the merge process repeats. 315.38 - Again, we take the first two arrays, and we compare the first numbers in them. 319.229 - This time its 239 and 214. 322.34 - 214 is lowest, so we take that number first. 325.76 - Now we look again at the first two numbers in both arrays: 239 and 250. 331.18 - 239 is lower, so we take that number next. 334.37 - Now we look at the next two numbers: 307 and 250. 337.78 - 250 is lower, so we take that. 340.28 - Finally, we\u2019re left with just 307, so that gets added last. 344.46 - In every case, we start with two arrays, each individually sorted, and merge them into a 348.909 - larger sorted array. 350.31 - We repeat the exact same merging process for the two remaining arrays of size two. 354.47 - Now we have two sorted arrays of size 4. 356.949 - Just as before, we merge, comparing the first two numbers in each array, and taking the 360.49 - lowest. 361.49 - We repeat this until all the numbers are merged, and then our array is fully sorted again! 365.22 - The bad news is: no matter how many times we sort these, you\u2019re still going to have 368.96 - to pay $214 to get to Indianapolis. 371.939 - Anyway, the \u201cBig O\u201d computational complexity of merge sort is N times the Log of N. 376.439 - The N comes from the number of times we need to compare and merge items, which is directly 380.34 - proportional to the number of items in the array. 382.819 - The Log N comes from the number of merge steps. 385.25 - In our example, we broke our array of 8 items into 4, then 2, and finally 1. 389.81 - That\u2019s 3 splits. 391.12 - Splitting in half repeatedly like this has a logarithmic relationship with the number 394.42 - of items - trust me! 396.27 - Log base 2 of 8 equals 3 splits. 398.34 - If we double the size of our array to 16 \u2013 that's twice as many items to sort \u2013 it only increases 402.969 - the number of split steps by 1 since log base 2 of 16 equals 4. 406.96 - Even if we increase the size of the array more than a thousand times, from 8 items to 410.379 - 8000 items, the number of split steps stays pretty low. 414.36 - Log base 2 of 8000 is roughly 13. 416.66 - That's more, but not much more than 3 -- about four times larger \u2013 and yet we\u2019re sorting 421.34 - a lot more numbers. 422.529 - For this reason, merge sort is much more efficient than selection sort. 426.43 - And now I can put my ceramic cat collection in name order MUCH faster! 430.129 - There are literally dozens of sorting algorithms we could review, but instead, I want to move 434.19 - on to my other favorite category of classic algorithmic problems: graph search! 438.169 - A graph is a network of nodes connected by lines. 440.84 - You can think of it like a map, with cities and roads connecting them. 443.68 - Routes between these cities take different amounts of time. 446.36 - We can label each line with what is called a cost or weight. 449.62 - In this case, it\u2019s weeks of travel. 451.509 - Now let\u2019s say we want to find the fastest route for an army at Highgarden to reach the 455.15 - castle at Winterfell. 456.42 - The simplest approach would just be to try every single path exhaustively and calculate 461.009 - the total cost of each. 462.46 - That\u2019s a brute force approach. 463.87 - We could have used a brute force approach in sorting, by systematically trying every 467.999 - permutation of the array to check if it\u2019s sorted. 470.979 - This would have an N factorial complexity - that is the number of nodes, times one less, 476.12 - times one less than that, and so on until 1. 478.759 - Which is way worse than even N squared. 480.99 - But, we can be way more clever! 483.28 - The classic algorithmic solution to this graph problem was invented by one of the greatest 486.93 - minds in computer science practice and theory, Edsger Dijkstra, so it\u2019s appropriately named 491.569 - Dijkstra's algorithm. 492.71 - We start in Highgarden with a cost of 0, which we mark inside the node. 496.21 - For now, we mark all other cities with question marks - we don\u2019t know the cost of getting 500.24 - to them yet. 501.24 - Dijkstra's algorithm always starts with the node with lowest cost. 504.349 - In this case, it only knows about one node, Highgarden, so it starts there. 508.439 - It follows all paths from that node to all connecting nodes that are one step away, and 512.66 - records the cost to get to each of them. 514.68 - That completes one round of the algorithm. 516.77 - We haven\u2019t encountered Winterfell yet, so we loop and run Dijkstra's algorithm again. 520.45 - With Highgarden already checked, the next lowest cost node is King's Landing. 524.26 - Just as before, we follow every unvisited line to any connecting cities. 527.92 - The line to The Trident has a cost of 5. 530.24 - However, we want to keep a running cost from Highgarden, so the total cost of getting to 534.49 - The Trident is 8 plus 5, which is 13 weeks. 537.36 - Now we follow the offroad path to Riverrun, which has a high cost of 25, for a total of 33. 542.6 - But we can see inside of Riverrun that we\u2019ve already found a path with a lower cost of 546.27 - just 10. 547.27 - So we disregard our new path, and stick with the previous, better path. 550.52 - We\u2019ve now explored every line from King's Landing and didn\u2019t find Winterfell, so we 554.96 - move on. 555.96 - The next lowest cost node is Riverrun, at 10 weeks. 558.68 - First we check the path to The Trident, which has a total cost of 10 plus 2, or 12. 563.0 - That\u2019s slightly better than the previous path we found, which had a cost of 13, so 567.011 - we update the path and cost to The Trident. 569.09 - There is also a line from Riverrun to Pyke with a cost of 3. 571.8 - 10 plus 3 is 13, which beats the previous cost of 14, and so we update Pyke's path and 576.96 - cost as well. 577.96 - That\u2019s all paths from Riverrun checked... so... you guessed it, Dijkstra's algorithm 581.751 - loops again. 582.751 - The node with the next lowest cost is The Trident and the only line from The Trident 586.36 - that we haven\u2019t checked is a path to Winterfell! 589.19 - It has a cost of 10, plus we need to add in the cost of 12 it takes to get to The Trident, 593.55 - for a grand total cost of 22. 595.68 - We check our last path, from Pyke to Winterfell, which sums to 31. 599.51 - Now we know the lowest total cost, and also the fastest route for the army to get there, 603.9 - which avoids King\u2019s Landing! 605.34 - Dijkstra's original algorithm, conceived in 1956, had a complexity of the number of nodes 609.86 - in the graph squared. 610.86 - And squared, as we already discussed, is never great, because it means the algorithm can\u2019t 614.55 - scale to big problems - like the entire road map of the United States. 618.36 - Fortunately, Dijkstra's algorithm was improved a few years later to take the number of nodes 622.5 - in the graph, times the log of the number of nodes, PLUS the number of lines. 626.7 - Although this looks more complicated, it\u2019s actually quite a bit faster. 630.14 - Plugging in our example graph, with 6 cities and 9 lines, proves it. 633.52 - Our algorithm drops from 36 loops to around 14. 636.56 - As with sorting, there are innumerable graph search algorithms, with different pros and cons. 641.68 - Every time you use a service like Google Maps to find directions, an algorithm much like 645.52 - Dijkstra's is running on servers to figure out the best route for you. 648.84 - Algorithms are everywhere and the modern world would not be possible without them. 652.76 - We touched only the very tip of the algorithmic iceberg in this episode, but a central part 657.15 - of being a computer scientist is leveraging existing algorithms and writing new ones when 661.38 - needed, and I hope this little taste has intrigued you to SEARCH further. 665.42 - I\u2019ll see you next week."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to CrashCourse Computer Science 0:10 - Recap of Programming Basics 0:30 - Understanding Algorithms 1:00 - Efficiency and Complexity of Algorithms 1:40 - Origins of the Term \"Algorithm\" 2:00 - Introduction to Sorting Algorithms 2:40 - Demonstration of Selection Sort 3:50 - Complexity of Selection Sort (Big O Notation) 4:50 - Merge Sort: A More Efficient Sorting Algorithm 6:30 - Complexity of Merge Sort 7:10 - Comparing Sorting Algorithms 7:40 - Introduction to Graph Search Algorithms 8:00 - Explanation of Graphs and Weighted Paths 8:40 - Dijkstra's Algorithm Explained 11:00 - Complexity of Dijkstra's Algorithm 12:00 - Practical Applications of Graph Algorithms 12:40 - Importance of Algorithms in Modern Computing 13:30 - Closing Thoughts on Algorithms"}]}

I don\u2019t have to say it all French-y. This is American history. 22.18 - And shut up French people about how if it weren\u2019t for your support in the American Revolution, this would be the History of Southern Canada. 28.16 - But other revolutions, like the Industrial Revolution, actually change things. 31.6 - So, which was the American Revolution? 33.689 - Well, little of column A, little of Column B. 35.729 - Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Yeah, we went from a bunch of rich white guys running the show all the way to a bunch of rich white guys running the show. 41.36 - You\u2019re not wrong, Me from the Past. 42.8 - But the 1700s were a pretty good century for rich white guys everywhere. 46.26 - I mean, they were running the show in Holland and Portugal and Spain, but only the United States became the country that invented baseball, the Model T, and competitive eating. 55.06 - So you\u2019re right, Me from the Past, but even if the US didn\u2019t live up to its rhetoric, that rhetoric was still powerful. 60.24 - And in the end whether you care more about ideas or policy defines whether you think the American Revolution really was Revolutionary. 66.82 - [Theme Music] 75.72 - All right, let\u2019s start with the War for Independence. 77.36 - If you\u2019ve been watching Crash Course, you\u2019ll know that we\u2019re not big on gratuitous war details. 81.08 - But we\u2019re obligated to tell you something about it. 83.3 - The main strategy of the British in the Revolutionary war was to capture all the cities and force the colonists to surrender. 88.27 - And the first part of that strategy pretty much worked. 90.35 - They captured Boston and New York and Charleston, but all the colonists had to do was NOT QUIT. 95.4 - I mean, they had home-field advantage, knowledge of the terrain, easier supply lines, and Mr. Creepy Eyes down here. 100.92 - So while the British took the cities, the Americans, or Continentals, held onto the countryside. 104.72 - The most famous battle of the war was probably the battle of Trenton, where Washington was like, 108.24 - \u201cI\u2019m gonna cross the Delaware on Christmas morning.\u201d 110.58 - He had a funny voice. Everybody knows he had a funny voice. It\u2019s famous. 113.1 - That\u2019s a made up fact! Don\u2019t put it on your AP test. 115.78 - \u201cWhat do I know about Washington? Well, I know he had a funny voice.\u201d 118.84 - Washington surprised a bunch of Hessians, which was a pretty impressive victory especially since he had just come off of a string of defeats. 123.78 - But he wasn\u2019t able to turn it into an all out rout, and ended up having to spend a miserable winter at Valley Forge. 128.22 - But remember, generals always get to eat. 130.64 - But the most important battle, at least in the North, was not Trenton, but Saratoga. 134.4 - This was a major defeat for the British, and while it\u2019s often put forth as an example of the superiority of the Continental fighting man, the British mostly lost because of terrible generalling. 142.88 - The French would eventually bankrupt themselves helping us, which would lead to their own Revolution. 146.8 - As thanks, we named our most important food after them. 149.42 - In the South the country-city trend continued with the British taking Charleston but then continuing to lose smaller scale battles and be harassed by guerrilla style tactics. 156.7 - The key battle of the war in the south \u2013 because it was the one where the British surrendered \u2013 was at Yorktown in 1781. 162.18 - Lord Cornwallis made the brilliant tactical decision to station his troops on a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by water filled with French ships, and the British lost the war. 170.8 - So what did this all mean for actual people? 172.88 - Well, Americans like to think that we all pitched in together and got rid of British tyranny, and lived happily ever after. 178.48 - Also that the Continental army was the bravest, most loyal, and most effective fighting force in human history thanks to the leadership of George Washington. 186.68 - [Patriotic Rock Music] 191.04 - But actually, well, yeah, let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 194.78 - Morale among continental soldiers was often pretty low. 197.66 - Rations were poor and soldiers went unpaid. 200.48 - As Joseph Plumb Martin, a soldier from Connecticut, wrote, they felt they were, 203.98 - \u201cstarving in detail for an ungrateful people who did not care what became of us.\u201d 209.01 - And many other colonists didn\u2019t fight for independence; they fought with the British. 212.85 - Others were pacifists, like the Quakers, who often had their property confiscated when they refused to fight. 216.89 - And in colonial America, of course, losing property also meant losing rights. 220.84 - And for slaves, the so-called fight for freedom was very different than it was for Continental soldiers, because loyalty to Britain in the war could mean freedom. 228.98 - In 1775, British governor Lord Dunmore issued a proclamation that granted freedom to any slave who deserted his master and fought for the British. 236.4 - Something like 5,000 slaves took him up on the offer. 239.34 - And in addition, many slaves saw the revolution as chance to escape. 242.72 - Boston King left a cruel master and later wrote, 245.54 - \u201cI determined to go to Charles-Town and throw myself into the hands of the English. 249.4 - They received me readily, and I began to feel the happiness of liberty, of which I knew nothing before.\u201d 255.04 - 100,000 slaves are estimated to have fled to the British. 258.48 - Now, many slaves were returned to their masters, but more than 15,000 left the U.S. when the British did. 263.1 - And it\u2019s worth remembering that the British empire abolished slavery in all of its territory by 1843 and without a civil war. 269.9 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. 271.08 - So, Native Americans were also profoundly affected by the Revolutionary War. 274.62 - Generally, they wanted to stay out of it, and the Colonists mostly wanted them to remain neutral, too. 278.76 - Like, the Continental Congress was eager to remind the Iroquois of their history of neutrality, writing: 283.06 - \u201cThis is a family quarrel between us and Old England. 286.0 - You Indians are not concerned in it. 287.94 - We don\u2019t wish you to take up the hatchet against the king\u2019s troops. 290.96 - We desire you to remain at home, and not join on either side, but keep the hatchet buried deep.\u201d 297.28 - Right, well, many of the Iroquois fought for the British, anyway. 300.07 - The Oneidas joined the Patriots, fighting against the Iroquois. 302.84 - Sometimes there were divisions within tribes themselves. 305.11 - Like, with the Cherokees; younger chiefs tended to side with the British, older ones with the Americans. 309.66 - And it should be mentioned that, unsurprisingly, American troops were particularly brutal to American Indians who fought for the British, burning their villages and enslaving prisoners, contrary to the accepted rules of war. 320.34 - And, if the American revolution was really about, as Thomas Jefferson would have it, \"the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" then the Indians were definitely the losers because they didn\u2019t get any of those rights. 330.99 - So, we know slaves and Indians didn\u2019t get much out of the Revolutionary War. 334.27 - How did it go for women? Yeah, not great. 336.65 - Some colonial women fought in the war: 338.4 - Deborah Sampson dressed up as a man and fought at several battles, once even pulling a bullet out of her own leg. 343.5 - But women didn\u2019t get much out of the Revolution \u2013 they were basically still considered wards of their husbands. 347.96 - Or, if they were unmarried, saleable assets of their fathers. 350.85 - However, the idea of Republican Motherhood became really important. 354.06 - It held that for the republic to survive, it was necessary to have a well-educated citizenry. 358.32 - And since women were the primary educators, they themselves needed to be educated so they could, to quote Founding Father Benjamin Rush, 364.889 - \u201cinstruct their sons in the principles of liberty and government.\u201d 368.009 - But not vote or own property. 369.49 - So the war didn\u2019t end slavery, it didn\u2019t much change the roles of women. 372.85 - And it didn\u2019t displace the elite, land-owning, pasty white guy leadership of America. 377.75 - So what was revolutionary? Well, the ideas. 380.18 - A lot of which are summed up in a single sentence of the Declaration of Independence: 383.44 - \u201cWe hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d 395.28 - So, when the colonies became states, they all created constitutions, which opened voting to more people. 399.64 - While most states still had property qualifications for voting, the bar was lowered, so there were far more voters than there had been. 405.46 - Although they were mostly white and male, but still. 407.28 - Another aspect of the American revolution that was pretty revolutionary was the beginning of true religious freedom. 412.15 - Like, with independence, the Church of England ceased to be the Church of America. 416.01 - And some founders, like Jefferson, were Deists, believing that God had created the world, but then stepped away to, like, create other universes or try to build a boulder too big for him to lift. 425.85 - Jefferson called for a \u201cwall of separation\u201d between Church and State that\u2019s best embodied in the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia, which Jefferson was so proud of that he had it mentioned on his tombstone. 436.199 - And the American revolution profoundly changed the economy, too. 439.13 - Like, all these new ideas of liberty led to a decline in apprenticeship and indentured servitude. 443.71 - And, immediately after the war, you began to see the split between the North, with its reliance on paid labor, and the South, with its reliance on slavery. 450.53 - Slavery was actually on the decline in the South until Eli Whitney went and invented the cotton gin in 1793, which: 456.039 - A. made it possible to turn a profit growing inferior American cotton, 460.24 - and B. reinvigorated slavery. Yay, innovation. 464.14 - Oh, no. It\u2019s time for the Mystery Document! 468.64 - The rules are simple: Mystery Document. Get it wrong: shock pen. Get it right: WOOO. 473.04 - \u201cAn equality of property constantly operating to destroy combinations of powerful families, is the very soul of a republic \u2013 480.52 - While this continues, the people will inevitably possess both power and freedom; 485.43 - when this is lost, power departs, liberty expires, and a commonwealth will inevitably assume some other form. 492.26 - Let the people have property, and they will have power \u2013 495.58 - a power that will for ever be exerted to prevent a restriction of the press, and the abolition of trial by jury, or the abridgment of any other privilege.\u201d 504.24 - Stan, why did you put communism in my Mystery Document? 506.81 - All right, so we\u2019ve got a fan of wealth distribution. 508.68 - But, it isn\u2019t Marx because: a) he\u2019s not American, b) he wasn\u2019t born. 512.289 - There were a bunch of far-left hippies in early America with their hemp-growing and their liberty-espousing. 517.56 - Ugh, I hate the shock pen. 519.52 - All right, I\u2019m gonna guess that it is noted lexicographer, Noah Webster. 523.94 - [Dinging Noise] AH HA YES! 525.96 - Yes, yes, yes! Yes! NAILED IT! Yes. 530.6 - Stan, that was the best one ever. That was my biggest victory to date. 533.78 - So it\u2019s worth remembering that some early Americans proposed a vision of liberty that sprung out of the idea of equality of property, which is very different from the way we imagine liberty today. 542.28 - But ideas of liberty \u2013 as diverse as they were \u2013 are really at the heart of what makes the American Revolution revolutionary. 547.92 - And that brings us back to slavery. 550.04 - The most common complaint among American high school students is that the Revolution was deeply hypocritical. 555.16 - I mean, how could this guy write that \u201cAll men were created equal\u201d when he himself held slaves? 560.44 - And had kids with one of them. 562.0 - And, even crazier, American colonists, often referred to themselves as slaves because they were denied the right to have a vote in parliament about their taxation. 570.44 - Now, some people recognized that it was a smidge hypocritical to claim to be enslaved by British taxation while they themselves were ACTUALLY enslaving people. 579.0 - But very few made the leap to say that liberty should mean freedom for the slaves. 583.14 - One exception was James Otis of Massachusetts who wrote, concerning America\u2019s slaves, that unless they were free, there could be no liberty: 589.24 - \u201cWhat man is or ever was born free if every man is not?\u201d 593.76 - But most of the Founders, including this guy and this guy, were the cream of the colonial elites, and so they held slaves and made arguments against abolition. 601.7 - Like, many historians now argue that Jefferson was trying to condemn slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but without slavery he wouldn\u2019t have had his amazing life. 609.38 - I mean, if he\u2019d been working, he couldn\u2019t have designed Monticello or stolen all of those ideas from John Locke. 614.36 - And speaking of Locke, Locke equated liberty with property. 617.82 - And a revolution based on securing property against tyranny couldn\u2019t very well turn around and take slaves, who after all were considered property. 625.96 - I mean, Jefferson once calculated that his slaves gave him a better financial return than his real estate investments. 631.22 - That being said, there were many and frequent protests against slavery. 635.24 - The most vociferous protesters were often African Americans, and in the northern states at least, their pleas were heard. 639.92 - Between 1777 and 1804, all states north of Maryland got rid of slavery, although most did so at a very slow pace and were careful not to deprive slave owners of the value of their property. 650.14 - Like, as late as 1830, there were still about 3,500 slaves in the North; 653.54 - and on the eve of the Civil war there were still 18 in New Jersey. NEW JERSEY. 657.82 - So, the number of free people of color in the U.S. skyrocketed. 660.42 - There were fewer than 10,000 in 1776; by 1810, there were nearly 200,000 free black Americans. 666.76 - So, in the end, real change came, as it usually does, not through a revolutionary event but through a revolutionary process. 673.54 - To me, the really novel idea that emerged from the American Revolution was of American equality. 678.04 - Now obviously this was (and remains) a vastly unequal social order, but I\u2019m talking about the kind of equality that Gordon Wood described in his famous book \u201cThe Radicalism of the American Revolution\u201d: 687.84 - The idea that no one American is inherently better than any other. 691.74 - Prior to the revolution, and certainly in Europe, there were definitely classes of superior people, usually determined by birth. 697.47 - I mean, people knew their place and they were expected to be deferential to their \u201cbetters.\u201d 701.05 - But all that talk of freedom and inalienable rights introduced the idea that birth wasn\u2019t destiny, and that all people should be treated with respect. 708.3 - And the idea that no one should be denied the opportunity to succeed because of who their parents were catalyzed change not just in America but around the world. 715.86 - And while the U.S. no longer leads in equality of opportunity, that early American idea that we are all equal in our capacity to reason and to work became the foundation not just for the American Revolution, but for many others that would come afterward. 729.16 - Thanks for watching.

Or is there really something behind it? 13.0 - Join us as we travel to Denmark and pull back the curtain 16.32 - at Alchemist. 19.84 - We\u2019re here in Refs-hal-ooven, 21.6 - a part of Copenhagen that was once a famous shipyard. 24.92 - Around here somewhere is the restaurant foodies rave about. 28.64 - I know Copenhagen is one of the world\u2019s safest cities, 31.64 - but this looks like a good place to get robbed. 34.24 - We find the enormous building that looks like a factory. 37.64 - Now, we are looking for massive bronze doors that an elephant could fit through. 42.16 - I think that\u2019s them. 43.92 - By pure chance we meet two guys who work at Alchemist. 47.32 - Lars composes the music and sound effects. 49.84 - and Jon is Creative Director. 51.92 - Wait, are we going to a restaurant or the theater? 55.72 - There are no handles on the door. 57.76 - Thankfully it opens on its own. 60.96 - We are welcomed into the lobby and given a camilla kombucha straight away. 65.16 - The lobby is a bit strange but the kombucha is amazing. 68.72 - The host asks us if we are ready for what\u2019s about to happen tonight. 72.46 - He gives us fair warning that Alchemist will touch on different areas. 77.36 - There are 5 acts, each in a different room, and first one is behind this curtain. 82.84 - As he opens it, he says that this part of the experience will introduce us to ourselves. 91.585 - What the hell is going on? 93.84 - Lots of big mirrors and deep questions. 96.72 - And this lady who serves our first amuse bouche 99.76 - a black seaweed wafer with raspberry and caramel. 103.0 - We are left chew on that and a quote by Edith Wharton 106.44 - the first woman to win a Pulitzer. 120.52 - Suddenly, we are in the lounge. 122.84 - This is my kind of place. 125.12 - Look at that wine tower. 126.64 - 8 meters and more than ten thousand bottles. 130.28 - They have pretty much any wine you can dream of. 133.04 - It\u2019s breathtaking. 134.72 - Then there is the window into a different world. 137.72 - It\u2019s the research and development kitchen. 140.04 - The wall is filled with jars of ingredients from around the world. 143.64 - The designers had to use fifteen hundred lights to get this effect. 147.48 - It looks like something from a Wes Anderson movie. 150.32 - Time for a welcome shot. 152.04 - This is the daisy, Denmark\u2019s national flower. 154.64 - Made into the form of a cocktail. 156.52 - It has a nice orange flavor with bits of frozen yuzu in it. 162.04 - This is wine director and our sommelier for the evening, Nina Jensen. 166.12 - She is kind and cheerful and really knows her wine. 169.12 - I like her already. 170.4 - She even lets me step into her world. 173.08 - It\u2019s three storeys of heaven. 175.08 - Alchemist is an official Ambassador of Krug, 177.4 - which means they have enough to fill a small pool. 180.44 - I like the sound of that. 182.2 - Nina and I talk vintage Krug. 184.24 - After we share stories about the ones we tried and ones we haven\u2019t. 188.8 - We are back to the table. 190.44 - Thats when Nina does something extraordinary. 193.24 - She changes my wine pairing. 195.04 - She takes out the Krug 2002 which I\u2019ve tried before. 198.48 - And she puts in a special vintage. 200.68 - The 1998 delayed release. 202.92 - The final year before Krug was bought by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy. 206.96 - This was a small thing for Nina but it meant a lot to me. 210.16 - And that made it taste even better. 213.44 - She shows me the interactive drink menu. 216.12 - I feel like the captain of the of the U.S.S. 218.0 - Enterprise. 218.96 - For drinks, you can choose a pairing, 221.36 - and there are lots of options. 223.56 - There is a non-alcoholic pairing and a mixed pairing each for 240 euro. 228.56 - The Exhibita Pairing includes wine, house spirits, botanicals, 232.84 - and two tea services for 375 euro. 236.56 - And then, wine. 238.32 - Alchemist has three levels. 240.56 - Essential, Amplified and Exclusive 243.08 - ranging from 240 to 1100 euro. 246.28 - I go for the last one, and Nina tells me she will customize it for me. 252.56 - Our first amuse bouche is called Smokey Ball 255.12 - It\u2019s puffed gluten filled with smoke and topped with caviar. 259.0 - When I bite into it, the aroma hits my nose at the same time the flavor hits my tongue. 264.08 - Hard to say more except that it was brilliant. 267.36 - I\u2019m still wondering how they got the smoke into the ball 270.16 - when who sits down beside me? 272.0 - Chef Rasmus Munk. 273.72 - He\u2019s a small-town boy. 275.4 - Son of a trucker and a nurse. 277.76 - Whose only restaurant experience growing up was McDonalds. 281.44 - He stumbles into cooking and after a few years, finds himself in fine dining. 285.88 - Soon, he is head chef. 287.68 - And he is only 22. 289.48 - One Christmas, he volunteers to cook for poor families. 292.96 - Nothing fancy, just traditional food. 295.72 - He is touched when he sees how moved they are. 298.4 - Far more than his usual customers. 301.12 - He is so disturbed by this, he quits fine dining. 304.48 - He realizes that he wants to do more than make food. 307.84 - He wants to make an impact. 309.84 - He opens a 15 seat restaurant in Oosterbrew. 312.84 - and calls it Alchemist. 314.64 - One of his early dishes turns many heads and a few stomachs. 318.2 - It\u2019s lamb\u2019s heart, served with a \u201cblood bag\u201d of cherry sauce. 321.6 - Under the plate is a brochure that asks. 324.64 - Have you signed up for organ donation? 326.88 - Fifteen hundred people sign up. 328.68 - It gets Chef Munk a ton of press. 331.6 - At this point he knows\u2026 333.04 - he is on to something. 334.76 - A few years later, Rasmus is ready to expand. 337.84 - He raises 20 million and opens Alchemist 2.0 341.56 - It has 52 seats and a whole lot of technology. 344.52 - Within 7 months, he has 2 michelin stars. 347.4 - I can\u2019t help but notice Rasmus has a little friend with him. 350.92 - It\u2019s our next amuse bouche. 352.64 - They raise the butterflies in-house and freeze dry them. 355.96 - Under it is cheese and a candy leaf. 358.6 - With this dish, Rasmus brings a new source of protein. 361.72 - 4 to 5 times more than beef. 364.2 - How many butterflies equals one steak I wonder. 367.68 - But you know what? 368.6 - It wasn\u2019t bad at all. 370.32 - Crispy, but the butterfly really didn\u2019t taste like anything. 374.36 - Our next impression is The Omelet. 376.24 - After years of traveling and hundreds of bad omelets, 378.92 - Chef Munk set out to make the perfect one. 381.36 - It\u2019s cooked egg yolk filled with more egg yolk and Comt\u00e9 cheese. 385.24 - Then it's heated to 52 degrees. 387.8 - We are told that\u2019s the sweet spot. 390.16 - But the flavor is anything but sweet. 392.44 - It\u2019s topped with paper-thin lardo and black truffles. 395.64 - It\u2019s the perfect temperature and texture with intense truffle flavor. 399.24 - Chasing perfection. 401.16 - The best egg dish ever. 402.92 - When you think of the word Alchemist, what comes to mind? 405.96 - The book? 406.6 - A strange old scientist? 408.12 - In the golden age, alchemy was a mix of science and magic that aimed to purify certain materials. 414.08 - Here in Copenhagen, Rasmus and the Alchemist team are doing just that, 418.64 - not with gold and silver, but with food and memories. 425.08 - When Nina feels we are ready, 426.4 - she leads us into the next room. 428.36 - This is called the Dome. 430.0 - Or as Nina puts it: 431.52 - The inside of Rasmuses head. 448.817 - He calls it Holistic Cuisine. 450.8 - It uses the word \u201cimpressions\u201d rather than \u2018courses\u2019. 454.16 - And there are 50 of them. 456.12 - The aim is to give people a dining experience outside the plate by activating all the senses. 461.6 - They\u2019re doing a damn good job of that so far. 464.64 - Rasmus says it was inspired by Copenhagen\u2019s Experimentarium. 468.56 - So far things have been great, but seeing all this flair makes me think twice. 473.88 - Is it all sizzle and no steak? 475.52 - Or is there a real experience waiting for me? 481.04 - This is called... 484.56 - It takes inspiration from George Orwell\u2019s novel. 487.44 - It makes look this issue straight in the eye as Big Brother watches. 491.2 - At the bottom, pork, pickles, Chanterelle mushrooms and lobster tartar 495.72 - and on top is caviar and jelly made from the eye of the 498.96 - codfish. 499.88 - Delicious dish and an eye-popping presentation that will stick with me for years. 506.04 - As we soon learn, not all the impressions are food. 509.04 - This next one is a drink. 510.56 - It\u2019s called cheers. 511.96 - Our server explains that in a few seconds, the lights will go out, 515.76 - and we should all cheers together. 517.88 - The lights go off, but our glasses are glowing. 520.92 - Cheers! 525.4 - We are distant from each other, but still we are all sitting at the same table. 530.24 - All 52 of us. 534.24 - The next wine makes me do a double take. 536.4 - Earlier, when we were touring the wine cellar, 538.56 - I noticed the 2010 Musigny Grand Cru. 541.48 - I pointed out to my wife that 2010 was a great year for Pinot Noir in Burgundy. 546.28 - And can you guess what magically showed up in the wine pairing? 549.6 - That\u2019s right. 550.52 - The 2010 Musigny. 552.32 - Coincidence? 553.4 - I don\u2019t think so. 554.32 - It\u2019s paired with an impression called the Tongue Kiss. 557.44 - This is made of silicone, and it\u2019s a replica of the human tongue. 561.48 - On top is pickled vegetables, edible flowers and chilies. 565.4 - I am supposed to suck and lick it off. 567.92 - This is a little awkward! 569.64 - After I got in there, it was actually fun. 572.28 - And gave us more than a few laughs. 574.48 - It might seem absurd, but this one really shows 577.36 - how important delivery is when we are talking about food. 581.2 - The same way a glass can change the taste of champagne. 584.24 - Drinking it from a professional glass is a different 586.72 - experience 587.24 - than spraying it straight into your mouth. 589.52 - The stuff on the tongue has bold, well-rounded flavors, 592.44 - and is the weirdest presentation of the evening. 595.04 - And maybe the year. 596.76 - That is exactly what Rasmus hopes his impressions will do. 600.2 - In interviews he talks about the theater and how it made a huge impression on him. 605.32 - In fact, this building was once a workshop for the Royal Danish Theater. 609.32 - Rasmus says the key to creating something new is play. 612.8 - Try everything and keep what sticks. 616.92 - This is plastic fantastic. 619.32 - Yes it\u2019s 100% edible. 621.56 - It brings our awareness to the oceans. 623.72 - Where there are plastic islands 2 kilometers wide. 627.08 - It may be hard to believe, but everything here is made of fish. 631.32 - The texture is really strange at first, but 633.6 - then the \u201cplastic\u201d quickly melts and leaves the creamy filling behind. 637.8 - The flavors and the message here are both on point. 641.36 - There is much more to Chef Rasmus Munk than making people think about plastic waste. 646.24 - During Covid he took the lead of a project called JunkFood 649.4 - to help feed the homeless in Copenhagen. 651.88 - Working with the city council and using social media to collect donations and volunteers, 656.48 - he used his four empty kitchens to make healthy delicious food for those living on the streets. 661.8 - He is not just raising awareness, he is leading by example. 666.68 - Our next impression is called Food For Thought. 670.2 - This is lamb brain. 671.92 - It is made into milk first, 673.4 - and served on a deep fried brioche\u00a0 with cream of lamb brain inside. 677.64 - The idea here is to think about the parts of the animal that go to waste. 681.96 - In many places, people eat nothing but the choice cuts of meat. 685.84 - Rasmus is trying to change that. 688.12 - My family was not the richest in the Hungarian countryside, 690.88 - in fact, we were quite poor. 692.36 - When I was growing up, we didn\u2019t waste a thing. 695.04 - We ate the animal from the nose to tail. 697.92 - So this dish wasn't shock for me, because of it's message. 700.72 - It was shock because this was the first time, 702.72 - I ate lamb brain. 704.08 - Although, I clearly see the importance of the message. 707.64 - Taking this idea one step further is Rasmuses newest project called Spora. 711.96 - It\u2019s the new global research center focused on food sustainability. 716.08 - They will develop new food\u00a0 sources like butterflies, 718.52 - and do something to nomalize eating things that many people throw away. 722.92 - To build it, Rasmus raised 1.3 million euro 726.0 - and bought a one thousand square meter space near Alchemist. 732.16 - One impression draws our attention to animal welfare. 735.16 - It\u2019s called Burned Out Chicken. 737.52 - Here we have a chicken wing. 739.28 - Chained to a cage. 740.96 - The bone is removed and it\u2019s filled with meat, roasted potatoes and masala. 745.8 - This impression literally forces us to come face to face with the issue. 750.0 - We are told not to eat the chain. 752.92 - Perhaps is absolutely unforgettable. 756.12 - Here these classic flavors fit together perfectly. 759.28 - The last wine in the pairing is a really important one. 762.44 - A dessert wine from producer Arnaud de Villeneuve back in 1936. 767.56 - It\u2019s crazy to think that this was bottled 3 years before World War 2. 771.76 - And its still absolutely delicious. 774.52 - Whenever I have a wine like this I feel really connected to history 778.48 - and a whole generation of people no longer with us. 782.32 - There is so much more I could show you, but then it would ruin the surprise. 786.16 - You\u2019ll have to check it out for yourself. 788.68 - The full menu with 50 impressions is the only thing you can order. 792.76 - It goes for 650 euros. 795.96 - After finishing our impressions in the dome, 798.04 - Nina takes us to the next room. 799.96 - But first, she says, take off your shoes. 803.08 - This is The Freedom Room. 805.08 - It\u2019s like a palette cleanser for the mind. 807.76 - No message, no themes 810.12 - just play. 811.32 - After the dome, we get an inside look at the kitchen\u2019s finishing area. 817.04 - Each column is a table, 818.72 - and here they put key information about which impressions have gone out, 822.0 - as well as any allergies. 823.72 - They can also track what will happen in the dome, 826.16 - so the service team doesn\u2019t interrupt any big moments. 831.32 - After 4 hours of dining and drama, we are on to The Balcony for our final Act. 836.6 - The low chairs and soft light make a great atmosphere 839.4 - to talk about our experience over the last few bites. 842.68 - Our total for today is 3600 euro for two people. 846.28 - So, is this place a big song and dance to take people\u2019s money? 850.28 - If they blindfolded me on the way in, 852.68 - and I ate my meal in the dark, 855.08 - I would still say: 857.24 - Unbelievable. 858.56 - Take away the theatre actors 861.04 - take away the dome 862.4 - take away the fancy production 864.8 - and you still have one of the best restaurants on earth. 868.84 - There are lots of restaurants out there where the story is better than the food. 873.4 - Here, both are wonderful. 875.6 - One more amazing thing about this place is the volume. 879.12 - With 50 courses and 52 people to serve, 882.52 - that\u2019s 2500 impressions pumped out by the team. 887.0 - Night after night. 888.92 - average stay is around six hours. 891.8 - That is unbelievable. 893.28 - It\u2019s all thanks to Chef Rasmus Munk, his vision, his team 896.64 - and an arsenal of cooking technology. 898.92 - From fire and smoke to molecules and modern chemistry. 903.04 - Also worth a special mention is Wine Director Nina Jensen, 906.76 - who did more than just select great wines. 909.2 - She listened. 910.48 - And modified the pairing to give me wines she knew I would find exciting. 915.36 - It was really memorable, 916.96 - one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. 919.16 - But still, the Michelin guide gives Alchemist just 2 stars. 922.76 - Why not three? 923.88 - I don\u2019t know how the inspectors make their decisions, 927.08 - but I do know what three stars means. 929.96 - Exceptional cuisine worth a special journey. 933.2 - I\u2019ve been to hundreds of fine dining restaurants 935.36 - and I can say that the food\u00a0 here is definitely exceptional. 939.56 - It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never had before and will never get anywhere else. 944.0 - But is it worth a special journey? 946.16 - If we could ask the thousands\u00a0 of people on the waiting list, 949.24 - Or those lucky enough to get a reservation when they sell out in 3 minutes. 954.12 - I\u2019m quite sure the answer would be: 957.28 - Yes. 957.88 - And that does it for this episode. 959.44 - Thank you for joining me! 960.72 -

But that isn't the whole story. 15.53 - Mr. Green, Mr. Green. What about Splinter? I think he was an architect. 19.22 - Ugh, me from the past, you\u00edre such an idiot. Splinter was a painter, sculptor, AND an architect. 24.04 - He was a quite a Renaissance rat. 25.86 - [theme music] 34.64 - Right, so the story goes that the Renaissance saw the rebirth of European culture after 38.34 - the miserable Dark Ages, and that it ushered in the modern era of secularism, rationality, and individualism. 44.82 - And those are all in the list of things we like here at Crash Course. 48.01 - Mr. Green. I think you're forgetting Cool Ranch Doritos? 50.34 - Yeah, fair enough. 51.38 - Then what's so controversial? Well, the whole idea of a European Renaissance presupposes 54.76 - that Europe was like an island unto itself that was briefly enlightened when the Greeks 58.64 - were ascendant and then lost its way and then rediscovered its former European glory. 63.57 - Furthermore, I'm going to argue that the Renaissance didn't even necessarily happen. 67.52 - But first, let's assume that it did. Essentially, the Renaissance was an efflorescence of arts 71.3 - (primarily visual, but also to a lesser extent literary) and ideas in Europe that coincided 75.79 - with the rediscovery of Roman and Greek culture. 77.94 - It's easiest to see this in terms of visual art, Renaissance art tends to feature a focus 81.83 - on the human form, somewhat idealized, as Roman and especially Greek art had. 85.91 - And this \"classicizing\" is also rather apparent in the architecture of the Renaissance which 89.5 - featured all sorts of Greek columns and triangular pediments and Roman arches and domes. In fact, 95.34 - looking at a Renaissance building you might even be able to fool yourself into thinking 98.76 - you're looking at an actual Greek building, if you sort of squint and ignore the fact 102.58 - that Greek buildings tend to be, you know, ruins. 104.9 - In addition to rediscovering, that is, copying, Greek and Roman art, the Renaissance saw the rediscovery 109.39 - of Greek and Roman writings and their ideas. 111.81 - And that opened up a whole new world for scholars, well, not a new world, actually since the texts 115.89 - were more than 1000 years old, but you know what I mean. 117.7 - The scholars who examined, translated, and commented upon these writings were called 121.49 - humanists, which can be a little bit of a confusing term, because it implies they were 125.06 - concerned with, you know, humans rather than, say, the religious world. 128.83 - Which can add to the common, but totally incorrect, assumption that Renaissance writers and artists 133.209 - and scholars were, like, secretly not religious. 135.709 - That's a favorite favorite area of speculation on the Internet and in Dan Brown novels, but 139.349 - the truth is that Renaissance artists were religious. As evidence, let me present you 143.76 - with that fact that they painted the Madonna over and over and over and over and over and STAN! 150.73 - Anyway, all humanism means is that these scholars studied what were called the humanities. 155.0 - Literature, philosophy, history. 157.36 - Today, of course, these areas of study are known as the so-called dark arts. What? Liberal 162.76 - arts? Aw, Stan, you\u00edre always making history less fun. I WANT TO BE A PROFESSOR OF THE DARK ARTS. 167.78 - Stan: The Dark Arts job is a dangerous position. 169.96 - Yeah, I guess that's true, so we'll stick with this. 172.019 - Right so here at Crash Course, we try not to focus too much on dates, but if I\u00edm going 175.109 - to convince you that the Renaissance didn't actually happen, I should probably tell you, 178.609 - you know, when it didn't happen. So traditionally the Renaissance is associated with the 15th 183.389 - and 16th centuries. Ish. 184.96 - The Renaissance happened all across Europe, but we\u00edre going to focus on Italy, because 188.2 - I want to and I own the video camera. Plus, Italy really spawned the Renaissance. 192.23 - What was it about Italy that lent itself to Renaissancing? Was it the wine? The olives? 196.26 - The pasta? The plumbers? The relative permissiveness when it comes to the moral lassitude of their 200.969 - leaders? Well, let\u00eds go to the Thought Bubble. 203.029 - Italy was primed for Renaissance for exactly one reason: Money. 206.879 - A society has to be super rich to support artists and elaborate building projects and 211.109 - to feed scholars who translate and comment on thousand-year-old documents. And the Italian 215.73 - city states were very wealthy for two reasons. 218.57 - First, many city states were mini-industrial powerhouses each specializing in a particular 223.559 - industrial product like Florence made cloth, Milan made arms. 227.74 - Second, the cities of Venice and Genoa got stinking rich from trade. 233.56 - Genoa turned out a fair number of top-notch sailors, like for instance Christopher Columbus. 237.96 - But the Venetians became the richest city state of all. 241.3 - As you'll remember from the Crusades, the Venetians were expert sailors, shipbuilders, 245.26 - and merchants, and as you'll remember from our discussions of Indian Ocean trade, they 249.279 - also had figured out ways to trade with Islamic empires, including the biggest economic power 254.589 - in the region: the Ottomans. 257.129 - Without trading with the Islamic world, especially in pepper, Venice couldn't have afforded 261.09 - all those painters, nor would they have had money to pay for the incredibly fancy clothes 265.53 - they put on to pose for their fancy portraits. 268.419 - The clothes, the paint, the painters, enough food to get a double chin, all of that was 273.49 - paid for with money from trade with the Ottomans. 276.389 - I know I talk a lot about trade, but that's because it\u00eds so incredibly awesome, and it 280.509 - really does bind the world together. 282.52 - And while trade can lead to conflicts, on balance, it has been responsible for more 286.25 - peaceful contacts than violent ones because, you know, death is bad for business. 290.61 - This was certainly the case in the Eastern Mediterranean where the periods of trade-based 294.11 - diplomacy were longer and more frequent than periods of war, even though all we ever talk 299.3 - about is war because it's very dramatic, which is why my brother Hank's favorite video 302.939 - game is called Assassin's Creed, not Some Venetian Guys Negotiate A Trade Treaty. 308.11 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. So here's another example of non-Europeans supporting the Renaissance: 312.06 - The Venetians exported textiles to the Ottomans. 314.5 - They were usually woven in other cities like Florence, and the reason Florentine textiles 318.43 - were so valuable is because their color remained vibrant. 321.45 - That is because they were dyed with a chemical called alum, which was primarily found in 325.74 - Anatolia, in the Ottoman Empire. 328.46 - So to make the textiles the Ottomans craved, the Italians needed Ottoman alum, at least until 1460. 334.429 - When Giovanni da Castro, Pope Pius II's godson, discovered alum, in Italy, in Tolfa. 340.659 - And he wrote to his godfather, the Pope: \"Today I bring you victory over the Turk. Every year 345.47 - they wring from the Christians more than 300,000 ducats for the alum with which we dye wool 350.84 - various colors, But I have found seven mountains so rich in this material that they could supply 355.939 - seven worlds. If you will give orders to engage workmen, build furnaces, and smelt the ore, 362.189 - you will provide all Europe with alum and the Turk will lose all his profits. Instead 367.919 - they will accrue to you.\" 370.36 - So the Pope was like, \"Heck yeah.\" More importantly he granted a monopoly on the mining 374.58 - rights of alum to a particular Florentine family, the Medicis. 378.59 - You know, the ones you always see painted. 380.5 - But vitally, Italian alum mines didn't bring victory over the Turks, or cause them to lose 384.909 - all their profits, just as mining and drilling at home never obviate the need for trade. 390.169 - Okay, one last way contact with Islam helped to create the European Renaissance, if indeed 393.75 - it happened: The Muslim world was the source of many of the writings that Renaissance scholars studied. 399.14 - For centuries, Muslim scholars had been working their way through ancient Greek writings, 402.58 - especially Ptolemy and Aristotle, who despite being consistently wrong about everything 407.36 - managed to be the jumping off point for thinking both in the Christian and Muslim worlds. 411.26 - And the fall of Constantinople in 1453 helped further spread Greek ideas because Byzantine 415.52 - scholars fled for Italy, taking their books with them. So we have the Ottomans to thank for that, too. 420.14 - And even after it had become a Muslim capital, Istanbul was still, like, the number one destination 424.09 - for book nerds searching for ancient Greek texts. 426.439 - Plus, if we stretch our definition of Renaissance thought to include scientific thought, there 430.18 - is a definite case to be made that Muslim scholars influenced Copernicus, arguably the 434.78 - Renaissance's greatest mind. 436.56 - Oh, it's time for the open letter? An Open Letter to Copernicus. 443.02 - But first, let's see what\u00eds in the secret compartment today. Wow, the heliocentric solar 449.06 - system? Cool. Earth in the middle, sun in the middle, earth in the middle, sun in the 455.499 - middle. Ptolemy. Copernicus. Ptolemy. Copernicus. 457.749 - Right, an open letter to Copernicus. 459.689 - Dear Copernicus, 460.77 - Why you always gotta make the rest of us look so bad? 462.659 - You were both a lawyer and a doctor? That doesn't seem fair. 465.729 - You spoke four languages and discovered that the earth is not the center of the universe, come on. 469.58 - But at least you didn't discover it entirely on your own. Now, there's no way to be sure 472.509 - that you had access to Muslim scholarship on this topic. 475.509 - But one of your diagrams is so similar to a proof found in an Islamic mathematics treatise 479.419 - that it's almost impossible that you didn\u00edt have access to it. 482.22 - Even the letters on the diagram are almost the same. So at least I can tell my mom that 485.84 - when she asks why I'm not a doctor and a lawyer and the guy who discovered the heliocentric solar system. 490.76 - Best wishes, John Green 492.479 - Alright, so now having spent the last several minutes telling you why the Renaissance happened 495.499 - in Italy and not in, I don't know, like India or Russia or whatever, I'm going to argue 499.96 - that the Renaissance did not in fact happen. 501.779 - Let's start with the problem of time. The Renaissance isn't like the Battle of Hastings 505.039 - or the French Revolution where people were aware that they were living amid history. 508.999 - Like, when I was eleven and most of you didn\u00edt exist yet, my dad made my brother and me turn 513.169 - off the Cosby Show and watch people climbing on the Berlin Wall so we could see history. 517.54 - But no one, like, woke their kids up in Tuscan village in 1512 like, \"Mario, Luigi, come 522.36 - outside. The Renaissance is here!\" 524.56 - \"Hurry, we're living in a glorious new era, where man's relationship to learning is changing.\" 529.62 - \"I somehow feel a new sense of individualism based on my capacity for reason.\" 533.68 - No. In fact, most people in Europe were totally unaware of the Renaissance, because its art 537.33 - and learning affected a tiny sliver of the European population. 540.93 - Like, life expectancy in many areas of Europe actually went down during the Renaissance. 545.27 - Art and learning of the Renaissance didn't filter down to most people the way that technology does today. 550.1 - And really the Renaissance was only experienced by the richest of the rich and those people, 553.9 - like painters, who served them. 555.64 - I mean, there were some commercial opportunities, like for framing paintings or binding books, 559.38 - but the vast majority of Europeans still lived on farms either as free peasants or tenants. 564.19 - And the rediscovery of Aristotle didn\u00edt in any way change their lives, which were governed 567.96 - by the rising and setting of the sun, and, intellectually, by the Catholic Church. 571.78 - In fact, probably about 95% of Europeans never encountered the Renaissance's opulence or art or modes of thought. 578.42 - We have constructed the Renaissance as important not because it was so central to the 15th 582.13 - century. I mean, at the time Europe wasn\u00edt the world\u00eds leader in, anything other than 586.39 - the tiny business of Atlantic trade. 588.55 - We remember it as important because it matters to us now. It gave us the ninja turtles. 593.63 - We care about Aristotle and individualism and the Mona Lisa and the possibility that 597.9 - Michelangelo painted an anatomically correct brain onto the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, 602.56 - because these things give us a narrative that makes sense. 605.52 - Europe was enlightened, and then it was unenlightened, and then it was re-enlightened, and ever since 610.26 - it's been the center of art and commerce and history. 613.04 - You see that cycle of life, death, and rebirth a lot in historical recollection, but it just isn't accurate. 618.74 - So it's true that many of the ideas introduced to Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries became very important. 623.92 - But remember, when we talk about the Renaissance, we\u00edre talking about hundreds of years. I 627.81 - mean, although they share ninja turtledom, Donatello and Raphael were born 97 years apart. And the 633.15 - Renaissance humanist Petrarch was born in 1304, 229 years before the Renaissance humanist Montaigne. 640.33 - That's almost as long as the United States has existed. So was the Renaissance a thing? 645.25 - Not really. It was a lot of mutually interdependent things that occurred over centuries. Stupid 651.89 - truth always resisting simplicity.

The Italian fella? Christian monk? Philosophical superstar of the 13th century? 8.84 - Aquinas thought morality was important for everyone, and that being a good person was a vital part of God\u2019s plan for each of us. 14.719 - But he knew that not everyone had been exposed to the Bible, or had even heard of God. 19.22 - So, what bothered him was: 20.84 - How could people follow God\u2019s moral rules \u2013 also known as the divine commands \u2013 if they didn\u2019t even know about the guy who made the commandments? 28.04 - Aquinas just couldn\u2019t believe that God would have expectations for us, if he didn\u2019t also give us \u2013 all of us \u2013 a way to meet them. 35.66 - So, Aquinas\u2019 theorized that God made us pre-loaded with the tools we need to know what\u2019s Good. 40.9 - This idea became known as the natural law theory. 44.24 - And there are a lot of versions of this theory still circulating around today. 48.28 - But Aquinas\u2019 original take on natural law is by far the most influential, and the longest standing. 53.98 - How influential? 54.92 - Well, if you\u2019re Catholic or a member of any of the major Protestant denominations, or were raised in any of those traditions, 59.98 - then you\u2019re probably already familiar with how Aquinas saw the moral universe and your place in it. 65.02 - Basically, God is awesome, and he made you. So, you are awesome. 69.859 - It\u2019s just important that you don\u2019t forget to be awesome. 73.32 - [Theme Music] 83.72 - We all want stuff. Aquinas got that. And he said that it was OK. 87.1 - In fact, the theory of natural law is based on the idea that God wants us to want things \u2013 specifically, good things. 93.94 - Aquinas argued that God created the world according to natural laws, predictable, goal-driven systems whereby life is sustained, and everything functions smoothly. 103.34 - And as part of this natural order, God made certain things that were good for his various creatures. 108.1 - Sunlight and water are good for plants. 110.22 - Meat is good for cats, and plants are good for bunnies. 112.92 - And \u2013 because God is awesome \u2013 he instilled all of his creatures with an intuitive desire for the things that he designed to be best for them. 120.16 - The things that we\u2019re designed to seek are known as the basic goods, and there are seven of them. 124.76 - The first thing that all living things just naturally want, Aquinas said, is self-preservation \u2013 the drive to sustain life. 130.94 - Aquinas thought God built all creatures with a survival instinct. 134.22 - And this appears to be pretty much true. 135.92 - I mean, we naturally avoid dangerous situations like swimming with hungry sharks, 140.54 - and when we find ourselves in danger, we don\u2019t have to stop and ponder the options before getting ourselves to safety. 145.64 - After preserving our own lives, our next most pressing basic good is to make more life \u2013 in other words, to reproduce. 152.1 - Some beings are able to do this on their own, but since we need to coordinate matters with a partner, God kindly instilled us with a sex drive, and made the process feel good, to make sure that we do it. 161.66 - Thanks, God! 162.9 - But once we manage to achieve our second basic good \u2013 reproduction \u2013 we need to educate those kids we just made. 168.48 - For humans, that\u2019s going to mean stuff like school and lessons in morality. 172.1 - But even non-human animals need to teach their babies how to hunt and avoid predators. 176.2 - Otherwise, the offspring they worked so hard to create aren\u2019t going to survive long enough to reproduce themselves, which, of course, is the goal of everything. 183.3 - And while these first goods seem to apply to a pretty wide swath of creation, some of the basic goods are just for humans, because of the particular kind of being we are. 192.38 - For instance, Aquinas thought we are built with an instinctual desire to know God. 196.78 - He believed we seek him in our lives, whether we\u2019ve been exposed to the idea of God or not. 201.6 - Interestingly, the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre agreed with Aquinas on this. 205.6 - He said we\u2019re all born with a god-shaped hole inside of us. 209.03 - The tragedy, for Sartre, is that he was an atheist, so he believed this was an emptiness that could never be filled. 214.52 - Next, taking a page out of Aristotle\u2019s book, Aquinas also said that humans are naturally social animals, so it\u2019s part of our basic good to live in community with others. 223.12 - While short periods of solitude can be good, he believed that we\u2019re basically pack animals, and our desire for love and acceptance, and our susceptibility to peer pressure, are all evidence of this. 232.42 - Now, since we naturally want to be part a pack, it\u2019s a good idea not to alienate our pack-mates. 237.42 - So, basically, Aquinas said we recognize the basic good of not pissing everybody off. 241.56 - I mean, he didn\u2019t actually say it that way. 243.47 - But if he did, I\u2019m sure it sounded a lot better in Latin. 245.92 - The point is, Aquinas said we feel shame and guilt when we do things that cause our group to turn against us, and that was another basic good. 253.14 - And finally, Aquinas said we\u2019re built to shun ignorance. 256.32 - We\u2019re natural knowers. 257.66 - We\u2019re inquisitive, and we want to be right. 259.86 - This is another trait we share with non-human animals, because knowledge promotes survival, and ignorance can mean starving to death or ending up as someone else\u2019s dinner. 267.7 - So these are the basic goods, and from them, we can derive the natural laws. 272.3 - We don\u2019t need the Bible, or religion class, or church in order to understand the natural law, Aquinas said. 277.58 - Instead, our instinct shows us the basic goods, and reason allows us to derive the natural law from them. 283.98 - Right acts, therefore, are simply those that are in accordance with the natural law. 288.65 - So how does this whole system work? 290.26 - Well, I recognize the basic good of life, because I value my own life. 294.14 - And that\u2019s clear to me, because I have a survival instinct that keeps me from doing dangerous, stupid stuff. 299.16 - Then, reason leads me to see that others also have valuable lives. 302.96 - And from there I see that killing is a violation of natural law. 306.14 - So, for each negative law, or prohibition, there\u2019s usually a corresponding positive one \u2013 a positive injunction. 312.4 - For example, \u2018Do not kill\u2019 is a prohibition, but there\u2019s also a positive injunction that encourages us to promote life. 318.74 - And I can take that positive injunction of promoting life to mean anything from feeding the hungry, to caring for the sick, to making healthy choices for myself. 326.5 - And we could do the same thing with each of the basic goods. 328.78 - The basic good of reproduction leads to a prohibition, don\u2019t prevent reproduction, which is why the Catholic Church has been so opposed to birth control. 335.66 - And the positive injunction there is: Do procreate! 338.7 - Do all the procreating you want! 340.68 - And if you think it through \u2013 using your God-given reason \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to see how the other natural laws are derived from the basic goods. 346.68 - But, of course, as with the Divine Command Theory, the theory of Natural Law raises plenty of questions. 352.06 - For example, if God created us to seek the good, and if we\u2019re built with the ability to recognize and seek it, then why do people violate the natural law all the time?! 361.5 - Like, if this is supposed to be something so intuitively obvious that even plants and non-human animals can manage it, why is the world so full of people-killing and offending others and folks who do everything but seek God? 372.789 - Aquinas had two answers for this: ignorance and emotion. 376.289 - Sometimes, he said, we seek what we think is good, but we\u2019re wrong, because we\u2019re just ignorant. 380.949 - And yes, that happens. 382.169 - I mean, there once was a time when cigarettes were literally what the doctor ordered. 386.52 - Back then, we thought we were promoting our health, but we were actually hurting it. 389.949 - No matter how awesome God made you, or your desires, you have to have some understanding of how to be awesome. 395.78 - But ignorance can\u2019t account for all of the stupid things we do. 400.12 - Aquinas, again following Aristotle here, said that, even though we\u2019re rational, we\u2019re also emotional creatures. 405.68 - And sometimes, we see what we should do, but emotion overpowers our reason, and we fail to do the things we know we should. 412.49 - So, in those cases, we just kinda forget to be awesome. 415.38 - Now, as with the Divine Command Theory, Natural law gives us a handy answer to the grounding problem. 419.62 - It tells us that morality is grounded in God, that he created the moral order. 423.629 - It also gives us a reason to be moral \u2013 following the natural law makes our lives work better. 428.74 - But while it seems to have a lot more going for it than divine command theory, natural law theory has its share of critics as well. 434.52 - First of all, it\u2019s not going to be super appealing to anybody who doesn\u2019t believe in God. 437.94 - You can tell me God set the world up according to natural laws, but if I reject that whole premise, there\u2019s not a lot you can do to convince me. 444.12 - Another objection comes from 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume, in the form of what\u2019s known as the is-ought problem. 450.2 - And to investigate this, let\u2019s pop over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy. 454.38 - Hume said it\u2019s fallacious to assume that just because something is a certain way, that means that it ought to be that way. 461.129 - But that\u2019s basically what natural law theory does all day long. 463.949 - We look at nature and see that creatures have strong survival instincts. 466.94 - So from there we conclude that survival instincts are good. 469.76 - But, are they? 470.91 - I mean, to me, yeah, because it helps me stay alive. 474.06 - But my survival instinct could also cause me to do all sorts of things that look immoral to other people. 479.26 - Like killing you and crawling inside your still-steaming body, tauntaun-style, to stay alive in a blizzard. 484.46 - Not that I would do that, but just for example. 486.78 - Likewise, we can observe the existence of sex drives and conclude that reproduction is good. 491.069 - But, sexual drive can also fuel terribly immoral things, like sexual assault. 497.33 - And for that matter, is reproduction always good? 500.36 - Is it something all beings have to do? 502.479 - Am I sinning if I choose never to have children? 505.059 - And what about bodies that can\u2019t reproduce? 506.789 - Or people who don\u2019t want to reproduce or have partners that they can\u2019t reproduce with? 510.569 - Thanks, Thought Bubble! 511.64 - As you can see, for all it has going for it, natural law theory can pretty quickly open some big ol\u2019 cans of philosophical worms. 517.959 - Which might be why 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant thought we needed a better option. 522.57 - Which we\u2019ll consider next time. 524.36 - Today, we learned about natural law theory, as proposed by Thomas Aquinas. 527.86 - We studied the basic goods and the way instinct and reason come together to point us to the natural law. 533.28 - We also discussed some problems with the theory, in particular, the is-ought problem advanced by David Hume. 539.14 - Crash Course Philosophy is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios. 542.779 - You can head over to their channel to check out a playlist of the latest episodes 545.81 - of shows like Blank on Blank, Braincraft, and Coma Niddy. 549.16 - This episode of Crash Course was filmed in the Doctor Cheryl C.

There is no \u201cme\u201d without it. There\u2019s no dogs 52.929 - without it. There\u2019s no animals. There\u2019s no -- there\u2019s no things -- there\u2019s things. 57.469 - It\u2019s important. That\u2019s why we\u2019re dedicating the next several episodes to the fundamentals 60.94 - of the nervous system -- its anatomy and organization, how it communicates, and what happens when 65.57 - it gets damaged. 66.7 - This is mission control, people! 78.72 - Even though pretty much all animals -- except super simple ones like sponges -- have a nervous 82.469 - system, ours is probably the most distinctive feature of our species. 86.89 - From writing novels, to debating time travel, to juggling knives -- all of your thoughts, 91.509 - and actions, and emotions can be boiled down into three principal functions -- sensory 96.509 - input, integration, and motor output. 99.64 - Imagine a spider walking onto your bare knee. 101.75 - The sensory receptors on your skin detect those eight little legs -- that information 106.049 - is your sensory input. 107.24 - From there your nervous system processes that input, and decides what should be done about 111.659 - it. That\u2019s called integration -- like, should I be all zen about it and just let it walk 115.52 - over me, or should I not be zen and freak out and run around screaming, \u201cSPIDER!\u201d? 121.319 - Your hand lashing out to remove the spider, and maybe your accompanying banshee scream, 125.679 - is the motor output -- the response that occurs when your nervous system activates certain 129.64 - parts of your body. 130.56 - As you can imagine, it takes a highly integrated system to detect, process, and act on data 134.98 - like this, all the time. 136.6 - And when we talk about the nervous system, we\u2019re really talking about several levels 139.62 - of organization, starting with two main parts: the central and peripheral nervous systems. 144.33 - The central nervous system is your brain and spinal cord -- the main control center. It\u2019s 149.14 - what decided to remove the spider, and gave the order to your hand. 152.5 - Your peripheral system is composed of all the nerves that branch off from the brain 156.23 - and spine that allow your central nervous system to communicate with the rest of your body. 160.2 - And since its job is communication, your peripheral system is set up to work in both directions: 164.6 - The sensory, or afferent division is what picks up sensory stimuli -- like, \u201chey, 169.09 - there\u2019s an arachnid on you\u201d -- and slings that information to the brain. 171.9 - Your motor, or efferent division is the part that sends directions from your brain to the 175.99 - muscles and glands -- like, \u201chey hand part, how \u2018bout you do something about that spider.\u201d 180.38 - The motor division also includes the somatic, or voluntary nervous system, that rules your 184.16 - skeletal muscle movement, and the autonomic, or involuntary nervous system, that keeps 188.6 - your heart beating, and your lungs breathing, and your stomach churning. 191.2 - And finally, that autonomic system, too, has its own complementary forces. Its sympathetic 195.93 - division mobilizes the body into action and gets it all fired up, like \u201cGah! SPIDER!\u201d 200.22 - -- while the parasympathetic division relaxes the body and talks it down\u2026 Like, \u201cit 204.28 - wasn\u2019t a black widow or anything; you\u2019re fine, breathe!\u201d 206.57 - So that\u2019s the organization of your nervous system in a nutshell. But no matter what part 210.68 - you\u2019re talking about, they\u2019re all made up of mainly nervous tissue, which you\u2019ll 214.45 - remember is densely packed with cells. 216.53 - Maybe less than 20 percent of that tissue consists of extracellular space. Everything else? Cells. 221.78 - The type of cells you\u2019ve most likely heard of are the neurons, or nerve cells, which 225.18 - respond to stimuli and transmit signals. 227.85 - These cells get all the publicity -- they\u2019re the ones that we\u2019re always thanking every 231.03 - time we ace an exam or think up a snappy comeback to an argument. 234.2 - But these wise guys really account for just a small part of your nervous tissue because 238.27 - they are surrounded and protected by gaggles of neuroglia, or glial cells. 243.63 - Once considered just the scaffolding or glue that held neurons together, we now know that 247.61 - our different glial cell types serve many other important functions, and they make up 252.59 - about half of the mass of your brain, outnumbering their neuron colleagues by about 10 to 1. 258.06 - Star-shaped astrocytes are found in your central nervous system and are your most abundant 261.85 - and versatile glial cells. They anchor neurons to their blood supply, and govern the exchange 267.03 - of materials between neurons and capillaries. 269.45 - Also in your central nervous system are your protective microglial cells -- they\u2019re smaller 274.14 - and kinda thorny-looking, and act as the main source of immune defense against invading 277.67 - microorganisms in the brain and spinal cord. 280.02 - Your ependymal cells line cavities in your brain and spinal cord and create, secrete, 284.26 - and circulate cerebrospinal fluid that fills those cavities and cushions those organs. 288.82 - And finally your central nervous system\u2019s oligodendrocytes wrap around neurons, producing 293.47 - an insulating barrier called the myelin sheath. 296.03 - Now, over in your peripheral nervous system, there are just two kinds of glial cells. Satellite 300.93 - cells do mainly in the peripheral system what astrocyte cells do in the central system -- they 305.43 - surround and support neuron cell bodies. While Schwann cells are similar to your oligodendrocytes, 310.56 - in that they wrap around axons and make that insulating myelin sheath. 314.03 - So don\u2019t sell your glial cells short -- they\u2019re in the majority, cell-wise. But of course 318.49 - when it comes to passing tests and winning arguments, most of the heavy lifting is done 322.95 - by the neurons. And they\u2019re not all the same -- they\u2019re actually highly specialized, 326.66 - coming in all shapes and sizes -- from tiny ones in your brain to the ones that run the 330.88 - entire length of your leg. 332.389 - But they do all share three super-cool things in common. 335.57 - Number 1. They\u2019re some of the longest-lived cells in your body. There\u2019s a lot of debate 339.7 - right now about whether you\u2019re actually born with all of the neurons you\u2019ll ever 343.63 - have, but some research suggests that, at least in your brain\u2019s cerebral cortex, your 347.95 - neurons will live as long as you do. 349.88 - Cool fact number 2. They are irreplaceable. It\u2019s a good thing that they have such longevity, 354.45 - because your neurons aren\u2019t like your constantly- renewing skin cells. Most neurons are amitotic, so 359.28 - once they take on their given roles in the nervous system, they lose their ability to 362.61 - divide. So take care of \u2018em! 364.47 - And number 3. They have huge appetites. Like a soccer-playing teenager, neurons have a 370.389 - crazy-high metabolic rate. They need a steady and abundant supply of glucose and oxygen, 375.38 - and about 25 percent of the calories that you take in every day are consumed by your 380.09 - brain\u2019s activity. 381.26 - Along with all these wonderful qualities, your neurons also share the same basic structure. 385.36 - The soma, or cell body, is the neuron\u2019s life support. It\u2019s got all the normal cell 389.19 - goodies like a nucleus, and DNA, mitochondria, ribosomes, cytoplasm. 393.29 - The bushy, branch-like things projecting out from the soma are dendrites. They\u2019re the 397.55 - listeners -- they pick up messages, news, gossip from other cells and convey that information to the cell body. 403.28 - The neuron\u2019s axon, meanwhile, is like the talker. This long extension, or fiber, can 407.8 - be super short, or run a full meter from your spine down to your ankle. We\u2019ve got a few 412.4 - different axon layouts in our body, but in the most abundant type of neuron, the axons 416.44 - transmit electrical impulses away from the cell body to other cells. 420.07 - For us students of biology, it\u2019s a good thing that nerve cells aren\u2019t all identical. 424.37 - Because their differences in structure are one of the ways that we tell them apart, and classify them. 428.75 - The main feature we look at is how many processes extend out from the cell body. 432.87 - A \u201cprocess\u201d in this case being a projecting part of an organic structure. 437.0 - 99 percent of all your neurons are multipolar neurons, with three or more processes sticking 442.3 - out from the soma -- including one axon, and a bunch of dendrites. 445.9 - Bipolar neurons have two processes -- an axon and a single dendrite -- extending from opposite 451.38 - sides of the cell body. They\u2019re pretty rare, found only in a few special sensory places, 455.15 - like the retina of your eye. 456.55 - Unipolar neurons, on the other hand, have just one process, and are found mostly in 460.06 - your sensory receptors. 461.4 - So, if you ever find yourself probing around someone\u2019s nervous tissue, remember these 464.979 - three terms to help you figure out what you\u2019re looking at. 467.53 - But because we\u2019re talking physiology here as well as anatomy, we have to classify these 471.29 - cells in terms of their function, and that basically comes down to which way an impulse 475.55 - travels through a neuron in relation to the brain and spine. 478.979 - Our sensory, or afferent, neurons pick up messages and transmit impulses from sensory 483.419 - receptors in say, the skin or internal organs, and send them toward the central nervous system. 488.78 - Most sensory neurons are unipolar. 490.72 - Motor, or efferent, neurons do the opposite -- they\u2019re mostly multipolar, and transmit 494.93 - impulses away from the central nervous system and out to your body\u2019s muscles and glands. 499.449 - And then there are interneurons, or association neurons, which live in the central nervous 504.34 - system and transmit impulses between those sensory and motor neurons. Interneurons are 508.84 - the most abundant of your body\u2019s neurons and are mostly multipolar. 511.81 - OK! It\u2019s applied knowledge time! Let\u2019s review everything we\u2019ve learned so far in 515.389 - terms of that spider on your knee. 517.259 - Those eight creeping legs first activate your unipolar sensory neurons in the skin on your 521.469 - knee, when they sense something crawling on you. The signal travels up an axon wrapped 526.069 - in Schwann cells and into your spinal cord, where it gets passed on to several multipolar interneurons. 532.019 - Now, some of those interneurons might send a signal straight down a bunch of multipolar 535.899 - neurons to your quadriceps muscle on your thigh, triggering you to kick your leg out 540.779 - before you even know what\u2019s going on. 542.41 - Other interneurons will pass that signal to neurons that carry it up your spinal cord to your brain. 546.66 - That\u2019s where your body first recognizes that thing as a spider, and the connections 550.559 - between neurons interpret and split the signal so that you can either scream, and start swinging 555.439 - your arms wildly about...or...remain calm, and with dignity remove the spider from your person. 561.16 - It\u2019s all based on the connections between neurons. 563.879 - Which brings me to a whole new question: How? 566.86 - How in the name of Jean-Martin Charcot do nerve cells use chemistry and electricity 572.069 - to communicate with each other? 573.61 - It\u2019s one of the most stupifyingly awesome and complicated aspects of your nervous system, 577.619 - and basically of all life and it is what we will cover in our next lesson. 581.47 - Today you learned how sensory input, integration, and motor output of your nervous system basically 586.49 - rules your world. We talked about how the central and peripheral systems are organized, 590.769 - and what they do, and looked at the role of different glial cells in nervous tissue function. 595.98 - We also looked at the role, anatomy, and function of neuron types in the body, both structurally 600.92 - and functionally, and how everything plays out when you find a spider crawling on your skin. 605.4 - Thank you for watching, especially to all of our Subbable subscribers, who make Crash 608.8 - Course possible for themselves and for the whole rest of the world.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:2.98 - Our last episode brought us to the start of the 20th century, where early, special purpose 7.05 - computing devices, like tabulating machines, were a huge boon to governments and business 10.769 - - aiding, and sometimes replacing, rote manual tasks. But the scale of human systems continued 15.509 - to increase at an unprecedented rate. The first half of the 20th century saw the 19.91 - world\u2019s population almost double. World War 1 mobilized 70 million people, and World 24.03 - War 2 involved more than 100 million. Global trade and transit networks became interconnected 28.77 - like never before, and the sophistication of our engineering and scientific endeavors 32.36 - reached new heights \u2013 we even started to seriously consider visiting other planets. 36.09 - And it was this explosion of complexity, bureaucracy, and ultimately data, that drove an increasing 41.9 - need for automation and computation. Soon those cabinet-sized electro-mechanical 46.94 - computers grew into room-sized behemoths that were expensive to maintain and prone to errors. 52.12 - And it was these machines that would set the stage for future innovation. 55.52 - INTRO 64.72 - One of the largest electro-mechanical computers 66.7 - built was the Harvard Mark I, completed in 1944 by IBM for the Allies during World War 2. 72.5 - It contained 765,000 components, three million connections, and five hundred miles of wire. 79.38 - To keep its internal mechanics synchronized, 81.66 - it used a 50-foot shaft running right through the machine driven by a five horsepower motor. 86.36 - One of the earliest uses for this technology was running simulations for the Manhattan Project. 90.64 - The brains of these huge electro-mechanical 92.32 - beasts were relays: electrically-controlled mechanical switches. In a relay, there is 97.5 - a control wire that determines whether a circuit is opened or closed. The control wire connects 102.33 - to a coil of wire inside the relay. When current flows through the coil, an electromagnetic 107.39 - field is created, which in turn, attracts a metal arm inside the relay, snapping it 111.76 - shut and completing the circuit. You can think of a relay like a water faucet. The control 116.13 - wire is like the faucet handle. Open the faucet, and water flows through the pipe. Close the 120.78 - faucet, and the flow of water stops. 122.54 - Relays are doing the same thing, just with 124.52 - electrons instead of water. The controlled circuit can then connect to other circuits, 128.85 - or to something like a motor, which might increment a count on a gear, like in Hollerith's 133.02 - tabulating machine we talked about last episode. Unfortunately, the mechanical arm inside of 137.45 - a relay *has mass*, and therefore can\u2019t move instantly between opened and closed states. 141.95 - A good relay in the 1940\u2019s might be able to flick back and forth fifty times in a second. 146.7 - That might seem pretty fast, but it\u2019s not fast enough to be useful at solving large, 151.3 - complex problems. The Harvard Mark I could do 3 additions or 154.16 - subtractions per second; multiplications took 6 seconds, and divisions took 15. 159.6 - And more complex operations, like a trigonometric function, could take over a minute. 164.18 - In addition to slow switching speed, another limitation was wear and tear. Anything mechanical 168.75 - that moves will wear over time. Some things break entirely, and other things start getting 172.82 - sticky, slow, and just plain unreliable. 174.66 - And as the number of relays increases, the 176.42 - probability of a failure increases too. The Harvard Mark I had roughly 3500 relays. Even 182.941 - if you assume a relay has an operational life of 10 years, this would mean you\u2019d have 186.959 - to replace, on average, one faulty relay every day! That\u2019s a big problem when you are in 191.81 - the middle of running some important, multi-day calculation. 194.4 - And that\u2019s not all engineers had to contend with. These huge, dark, and warm machines 198.03 - also attracted insects. In September 1947, operators on the Harvard Mark II pulled a 203.2 - dead moth from a malfunctioning relay. Grace Hopper who we\u2019ll talk more about in a later episode noted, 208.28 - \u201cFrom then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, 211.02 - we said it had bugs in it.\u201d 212.7 - And that\u2019s where we get the term computer bug. 214.51 - It was clear that a faster, more reliable alternative to electro-mechanical relays was 218.18 - needed if computing was going to advance further, and fortunately that alternative already existed! 223.81 - In 1904, English physicist John Ambrose Fleming developed a new electrical component called 229.07 - a thermionic valve, which housed two electrodes inside an airtight glass bulb - this was the 234.23 - first vacuum tube. One of the electrodes could be heated, which would cause it to emit electrons 239.92 - \u2013 a process called thermionic emission. The other electrode could then attract these 244.159 - electrons to create the flow of our electric faucet, but only if it was positively charged 249.069 - - if it had a negative or neutral charge, the electrons would no longer be attracted 253.1 - across the vacuum so no current would flow. 255.56 - An electronic component that permits the one-way 257.76 - flow of current is called a diode, but what was really needed was a switch to help turn 262.56 - this flow on and off. Luckily, shortly after, in 1906, American inventor Lee de Forest added 268.11 - a third \u201ccontrol\u201d electrode that sits between the two electrodes in Fleming\u2019s design. 272.569 - By applying a positive charge to the control electrode, it would permit the flow 276.96 - of electrons as before. But if the control electrode was given a negative charge, it 281.58 - would prevent the flow of electrons. So by manipulating the control wire, one could 285.68 - open or close the circuit. It\u2019s pretty much the same thing as a relay - but importantly, 289.819 - vacuum tubes have no moving parts. This meant there was less wear, and more importantly, 293.83 - they could switch thousands of times per second. These triode vacuum tubes would become the 298.319 - basis of radio, long distance telephone, and many other electronic devices for nearly a 302.74 - half century. I should note here that vacuum tubes weren\u2019t perfect - they\u2019re kind of 307.22 - fragile, and can burn out like light bulbs, they were a big improvement over mechanical relays. 311.44 - Also, initially vacuum tubes were expensive 314.22 - \u2013 a radio set often used just one, but a computer might require hundreds or thousands of electrical switches. 320.44 - But by the 1940s, their cost and reliability had improved to 323.98 - the point where they became feasible for use in computers\u2026. at least by people with deep 328.449 - pockets, like governments. This marked the shift from electro-mechanical 331.99 - computing to electronic computing. Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 335.849 - The first large-scale use of vacuum tubes for computing was the Colossus Mk 1 designed 340.7 - by engineer Tommy Flowers and completed in December of 1943. The Colossus was installed 346.349 - at Bletchley Park, in the UK, and helped to decrypt Nazi communications. 350.37 - This may sound familiar because two years prior Alan Turing, often called the father 354.21 - of computer science, had created an electromechanical device, also at Bletchley Park, called the 359.629 - Bombe. It was an electromechanical machine designed to break Nazi Enigma codes, but the 364.219 - Bombe wasn\u2019t technically a computer, and we\u2019ll get to Alan Turing\u2019s contributions 368.2 - later. Anyway, the first version of Colossus contained 370.96 - 1,600 vacuum tubes, and in total, ten Colossi were built to help with code-breaking. 377.24 - Colossus is regarded as the first programmable, electronic computer. 380.74 - Programming was done by plugging hundreds of wires into plugboards, sort of like old 385.179 - school telephone switchboards, in order to set up the computer to perform the right operations. 389.879 - So while \u201cprogrammable\u201d, it still had to be configured to perform a specific computation. 395.349 - Enter the The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator \u2013 or ENIAC \u2013 completed 400.34 - a few years later in 1946 at the University of Pennsylvania. 404.32 - Designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, this was the world's first truly general purpose, 410.52 - programmable, electronic computer. 412.62 - ENIAC could perform 5000 ten-digit additions or subtractions per second, many, many times 418.08 - faster than any machine that came before it. It was operational for ten years, and is estimated 423.08 - to have done more arithmetic than the entire human race up to that point. 427.139 - But with that many vacuum tubes failures were common, and ENIAC was generally only operational 431.669 - for about half a day at a time before breaking down. 434.36 - Thanks Thought Bubble. By the 1950\u2019s, even vacuum-tube-based computing was reaching its limits. 439.8 - The US Air Force\u2019s AN/FSQ-7 computer, which was completed in 1955, was part of the 445.52 - \u201cSAGE\u201d air defense computer system we\u2019ll talk more about in a later episode. 449.36 - To reduce cost and size, as well as improve reliability and speed, a radical new electronic 454.27 - switch would be needed. In 1947, Bell Laboratory scientists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, 459.56 - and William Shockley invented the transistor, and with it, a whole new era of computing was born! 465.12 - The physics behind transistors is pretty complex, relying on quantum mechanics, 469.38 - so we\u2019re going to stick to the basics. 471.74 - A transistor is just like a relay or vacuum tube - it\u2019s a switch that can be opened 476.009 - or closed by applying electrical power via a control wire. Typically, transistors have 480.52 - two electrodes separated by a material that sometimes can conduct electricity, and other 485.569 - times resist it \u2013 a semiconductor. In this case, the control wire attaches to 490.28 - a \u201cgate\u201d electrode. By changing the electrical charge of the gate, the conductivity of the 495.22 - semiconducting material can be manipulated, allowing current to flow or be stopped \u2013 like 500.26 - the water faucet analogy we discussed earlier. Even the very first transistor at Bell Labs 504.5 - showed tremendous promise \u2013 it could switch between on and off states 10,000 times per second. 510.16 - Further, unlike vacuum tubes made of glass and with carefully suspended, fragile 514.5 - components, transistors were solid material known as a solid state component. 519.26 - Almost immediately, transistors could be made smaller than the smallest possible relays or vacuum tubes. 523.84 - This led to dramatically smaller and cheaper computers, like the IBM 608, released in 1957 530.04 - \u2013 the first fully transistor-powered, commercially-available computer. 533.389 - It contained 3000 transistors and could perform 4,500 additions, or roughly 539.3 - 80 multiplications or divisions, every second. IBM soon transitioned all of its computing 544.42 - products to transistors, bringing transistor-based computers into offices, and eventually, homes. 550.24 - Today, computers use transistors that are smaller than 50 nanometers in size \u2013 for 554.9 - reference, a sheet of paper is roughly 100,000 nanometers thick. And they\u2019re not only incredibly 560.14 - small, they\u2019re super fast \u2013 they can switch states millions of times per second, and can run for decades. 567.0 - A lot of this transistor and semiconductor development happened in the Santa Clara  Valley, 571.62 - between San Francisco and San Jose, California. 574.38 - As the most common material used to create semiconductors is silicon, this 578.511 - region soon became known as Silicon Valley. Even William Shockley moved there, founding 583.15 - Shockley Semiconductor, whose employees later founded 586.2 - Fairchild Semiconductors, whose employees later founded 589.509 - Intel - the world\u2019s largest computer chip maker today. 592.66 - Ok, so we\u2019ve gone from relays to vacuum tubes to transistors. We can turn electricity 597.68 - on and off really, really, really fast. But how do we get from transistors to actually 602.44 - computing something, especially if we don\u2019t have motors and gears? 606.4 - That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to cover over the next few episodes. 609.14 - Thanks for watching.

analyst Journey so here is a 6mon road 30.32 - map that I personally would use I'd 32.48 - split up the road map into three 34.719 - different parts the skills the projects 38.239 - and the job applications and put a date 41.079 - on the calendar 6 months from now and 43.399 - work backwards from it so in months one 46.399 - to three I will work on skills in month 49.12 - four I would work on projects and then 51.399 - month five and six is the job 53.6 - application process and 6 months is very 57.399 - reasonable if you have about 3 to 4 60.039 - hours to study every day and everybody 62.84 - has different schedules and different 64.799 - commitments but if that's something that 66.68 - you can commit to this Roat would work 68.84 - for you I also have a video on how I was 71.88 - able to self-study for 4 hours every day 74.6 - and if you're looking for tips there I 76.439 - will link the video above months 1 78.68 - through three is skills knowing what I 80.64 - know today I would really just focus on 83.0 - learning three tools and that is Excel 86.119 - SQL and Tapo I would learn it in that 89.079 - order and just focus on just those three 91.56 - for 3 months I'm not including python 94.36 - Cloud technology other bi tools because 97.6 - most entry-level data analyst roles will 100.439 - only require you to know those three 102.84 - skills that I listed and from my 104.96 - personal experience as well those were 107.159 - the only three tools I used for years so 109.96 - that is enough to get you started and 111.88 - you can worry about learning the other 113.52 - skills after you Le the job Excel is the 116.32 - first tool that I would learn because 118.68 - Excel is still the most popular bi tool 121.68 - used across Industries and it's highly 124.719 - likely that in your first role as a data 127.039 - analyst you'll be using a lot of excel 129.8 - you need to know how to clean analyze 132.28 - and present data using Excel and what 135.879 - level do you need about an intermediate 138.16 - level where you know key functions like 140.64 - vup pivot tables how to create 144.0 - visualizations and what I would do in my 146.4 - road map is break it down into smaller 149.04 - pieces so spend a week learning just the 151.64 - formulas and getting used to them and 153.84 - then spend the following week on 155.56 - visualizations and thinking through how 157.64 - you can visualize data using charts and 160.12 - graphs the best way to learn is by doing 162.959 - rather than moving on to SQL as soon as 166.04 - you finish Excel take the time to 168.64 - practice it what I would do is take my 170.76 - bank statement and try to do some 173.239 - analysis you can try answering questions 176.12 - like what does the trend of my spending 179.28 - look like and this would require taking 181.44 - all your spending and putting it on a 183.72 - line graph where you can see the trend 185.92 - of the increases and decreases of 188.12 - spending over time and then you can try 190.72 - bucketing your spending into categories 193.2 - like entertainment food and chart those 196.319 - categories over time to see how you're 198.56 - spending changes by category over time 201.72 - and this is the type of analysis that a 204.159 - data analyst would do next is seel seel 207.68 - is fundamental to be a data analyst if 211.48 - you have a technical assessment for your 214.08 - data analyst job it will 100% be in SQL 218.64 - data is stored in databases and SQL is a 222.4 - language that you use to talk to 225.159 - databases to get the information that 227.36 - you need SQL is a more powerful tool 230.319 - than Excel because it allows you to work 233.239 - with really large data set and also be 236.2 - able to combine them to easily create 239.239 - different analysis you only need to be 241.879 - an intermediate level SQL user note I 245.079 - didn't say Advanced and that includes 247.64 - functions like select wear Group by 251.72 - having joins and window functions some 254.64 - websites I personally use to learn SQL 257.28 - are data Camp Udi LinkedIn learning data 260.919 - Camp was extremely useful because it 263.12 - allowed me to interactively learn SQL 266.24 - handson without having to download 268.199 - anything as well as LinkedIn learning if 271.52 - you are in the US a lot of public 274.08 - libraries actually offer a free 276.4 - subscription so I was able to do a lot 278.72 - of my learning for free through Linkedin 280.84 - learning and lastly don't forget YouTube 283.12 - because there's a lot of really good 285.039 - free tutorials on YouTube that you 287.28 - should use as well next we move on to 290.0 - Tableau now any bi visualization tool 293.12 - can be used in place of Tableau such as 295.72 - powerbi or looker or quick ey but I 299.12 - personally would learn Tableau because 301.36 - it is the most commonly used tool that 304.36 - you'll see on job listings also from my 307.08 - experience when you start learning just 309.16 - one bi tool you know about 80% of others 312.72 - so it's really not as important which 315.08 - one you pick here so what should you 316.919 - know in Tau you should be about an 319.6 - intermediate user that knows how to 321.96 - connect to data add multiple data 324.28 - sources as well as creating 326.639 - visualizations with filters will get you 329.16 - pretty far there's also a free version 331.479 - of Tableau that you can download and 333.72 - start practicing and you can even take 336.24 - the same bank statement data that you 338.44 - had earlier and use that to create some 341.28 - of the same visualizations to get 343.44 - practice month four is projects this is 346.16 - a step that I wouldn't skip because 349.44 - without any data work experience I don't 352.639 - have anything to show recruiters that I 355.36 - know how to do data analysis so knowing 358.199 - that the purpose of these project 359.479 - projects is to use on my resume and 361.68 - interviews I would strategically use 364.479 - them to make myself stand out here are 367.199 - three tips for your projects tip one I'd 370.24 - create three to four projects that shows 373.319 - a combination of my skills so I wouldn't 376.36 - create a project in just Excel and a 379.36 - project in just SQL I would do a 382.28 - combination of Excel and SQL or SQL in 385.56 - Tableau and this shows the recruiter 388.199 - that I know which tools to use to solve 391.039 - which problems tip number two I create 393.84 - projects that have an analysis that 396.24 - solves a problem and tells a story data 399.44 - analysts always start their process 401.319 - first with the problem and it's no 404.12 - different for a project a common mistake 407.039 - is to start with the data set first with 409.44 - no plan and then work aimlessly without 412.52 - knowing what it is that you're going to 414.56 - do it's like when I'm looking at the 416.52 - bank statement data and without a 418.72 - problem statement I would just take it 420.919 - and create all sorts of fancy graphs 423.68 - that look really good but don't mean 426.12 - anything it's only when I have the 428.199 - problem statement of what does a trend 430.479 - of my spending look like that I actually 432.8 - have a direction and can sit down and 435.36 - think about well how would I best show 437.8 - this through a visualization and tell a 440.199 - story tip number three use free 442.96 - resources for data such as kaggle Reddit 447.44 - data.gov and even corser does have 450.199 - guided projects that you can pay for 452.44 - months 5 through 6 is the job 454.72 - application process I would prepare for 457.12 - interviews by updating my resume my 459.96 - LinkedIn and applying for data analyst 462.44 - jobs and I do have a video on how to 465.68 - create a data analyst resume with 468.36 - actionable tips which I'll leave up 470.479 - there for you to watch while applying 472.599 - for jobs I would start practicing 474.52 - technical questions pretty much every 477.199 - single data analyst job that I applied 480.0 - to has required a SQL technical 483.08 - assessment along with the general 485.319 - interview and I didn't know this and was 488.479 - completely unprepared but you know 490.759 - better so in month 5 give yourself 493.56 - enough time to take some technical test 496.199 - so that when it comes time for the 498.08 - actual interview you'll be ready I've 500.759 - personally used Le code hacker rank for 503.639 - SQL interview questions and they were 506.599 - actually pretty accurate to the ones 508.72 - that I gotten in real life so try and do 512.2 - the medium easy questions and if you can 515.0 - pass those then you'll be prepared with 517.36 - this R map I would start and then learn 520.2 - not learn and then start I hope this is 522.919 - the video that starts you on your data 524.959 - analyst journey and if you're interested 527.24 - in learning more about the soft skills a 529.44 - data analyst uses watch how to get ahead 532.36 - of 99% of data analyst and I will see 535.48 - you there"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.0 - Hi there, my name\u2019s John Green and this is Crash Course: World History, and today we\u2019re going to talk about Egypt. 4.5 - No, not that Egypt. Older. 7.2 - Older. Older. 9.48 - Less fictional. Yes, that one. 12.38 - Ancient Egypt is probably the most influential of the river valley civilizations. 15.4 - Like you might not recognize any Assyrian Kings or Assyrian language, but you probably do know King Tut. 21.84 - And you may recognize that the Eye of Horus is right now staring at me and judging me. 25.92 - I can feel, I can feel your judgement. 27.93 - [Theme Music] 36.88 - When we think of Ancient Civilizations, we think of Egypt. 39.84 - There are a few reasons for this, like the fact that the pyramids are the last man standing among the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World. 45.72 - But more importantly, Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted from 3000 BCE to 332 BCE. 53.72 - That\u2019s a period that historians call a long-ass time. 58.0 - And I will remind you it is not cursing if I'm talking about donkeys. 61.61 - So there are many approaches to the study of history. You could view history as a millennial 64.78 - long conversation about philosophy or as clashes between great men or you can see history through 69.71 - the lens of traditionally neglected populations, like women or indigenous peoples or slaves. 75.58 - And we\u2019re going to try to take many approaches to our study of history during Crash Course. 79.97 - Mr. Green, Mr. Green, which approach is right? I mean, for the test. 85.04 - Oh me-from-the-past. Remember how you spent all of third year French writing notes back 89.42 - and forth to that girl and she eventually agreed to go out with you and you did make 92.71 - it to second base but now you can hardly parle un mot de francais? 96.189 - Historical lenses are like that, my friend: With every choice, something is gained and something is lost. 101.229 - Right, so in discussing agriculture and early civilizations, we\u2019ve been approaching history 105.509 - through the lens of resource distribution and geography. 108.46 - And just as the violent and capricious Tigris and Euphrates rivers shaped the worldview 112.61 - of early Mesopotamians, the Nile shaped the world view of the Egyptians. Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 118.189 - The Nile was regular, navigable, and benign, making for one of the safest and richest agricultural 123.369 - areas in the world. Each summer the river flooded the fields at precisely the right 127.17 - time, leaving behind nutrient-rich silt for planting season. 130.92 - Planting was so easy that Egyptians just tossed seeds around the silty earth and then let 135.19 - their cattle or pigs walk on it to press the seeds into the ground, and then boom, grain 140.47 - and figs and wheat and pomegranates and melons and joy. 144.68 - Unlike most river valley civilizations, Egyptian communities existed ONLY along the Nile, which 150.379 - was navigable enough to get valuable resources downstream from timber to gold, which the Egyptians 156.4 - considered the divine metal, thereby introducing an idea that would eventually culminate in Mr. T. 160.9 - The Nile is also easily tamed. While other river valley civilizations needed complicated 165.41 - and labor-intensive hydraulic engineering projects to irrigate crops, the Nile was so 170.3 - chill that Egyptians could use a simple form of water management called basin irrigation, 174.989 - in which farmers used floodwaters to fill earthen basins and canals for irrigation. 179.12 - In short, the awesomeness of the Nile meant Egyptians could create big food surpluses 183.34 - with relatively little work, allowing time and energy for some pretty impressive projects. 188.319 - Also, the Nile may help explain the ancient Egypt\u2019s general optimism: 192.01 - While ancient Sumerian religion, for instance, saw the afterlife as this gloomy, dark place, 197.879 - Egyptians were often buried with things that were useful and pleasurable to them in life, 202.349 - because the Afterlife was seen as a continuation of this life, which, at least if you lived 207.04 - along the Nile, wasn\u2019t half-bad. 208.98 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. 210.55 - And now, my dear pupils, I shall terrorize you with the oppression of dates. No. Dates. 216.71 - Yes. Thank you. 218.48 - Historians have divided Egyptian history into three broad categories. Each with their own 222.629 - numbered dynasties. But only hardcore Egyptologists know the dynasties, and we\u2019re not trying 226.7 - to become hardcore Egyptologists. 228.45 - The Old Kingdom lasted from 2649 to 2152; 231.76 - The middle kingdom from 2040 to 1640; 233.76 - And the New Kingdom, so called because it is only 3,000 years old, lasted from 1550-1070 BCE. 238.47 - In between you have a couple so-called Intermediate periods. Okay, OLD KINGDOM. 243.45 - This was really the glory age of ancient Egypt, when we get all the stuff that will later 247.08 - make Indiana Jones possible, like the pyramids at Giza, and the sun king Ra, and the idea of divine kingship. 253.8 - The king, or Pharoh, was either a god or very close to a god. 257.099 - which seems like a good gig, except that it meant that he wasn\u2019t expected to act like 260.68 - a person, he was expected to act like a god, which in ancient Egypt means acting like the 265.479 - Nile: calm, cool, benevolent... There\u2019s no fun it that. 270.639 - And then of course there are the pyramids, which aside from remaining impressive to behold 274.4 - represent a remarkable degree of political and social control over the population, because 279.639 - it is not easy to convince people to devote their lives to building a sarcophagus for someone else. 284.839 - The most famous pyramids were built between 2575 and 2465 BCE. 288.99 - The one with the Sphinx was for Khephren; 291.259 - the largest, the Great Pyramid, was built for the Pharaoh Khufu. 294.499 - These pyramids were built partly by peasants who were required by Egyptian law to work 298.719 - for the government a certain number of months per year, 301.149 - and partly by slaves, but not by Moses and the Jews, who showed up on the scene long 305.309 - before pyramids were ever even a twinkle in Khufu\u2019s eye. 308.96 - This leads to an overwhelming question: Why? Why in the sweet name of Ra would anyone ever 315.96 - build such a thing? 317.399 - Well, let\u2019s start with Ra. So, Ra started out as a regional god, reigning over Heliopolis, 321.33 - but he eventually became really central to the entire pantheon of gods of ancient Egypt. 325.559 - He was the god of the sun, but also the god of creation. 328.369 - And the thinking was that if humans did their jobs then the pantheon of gods would maintain 332.029 - cosmic order, and since the pharaohs became gods upon their death, it made sense to please 338.119 - them even unto pyramids. 340.61 - Egyptian popular religion also embraced the belief in amulets and magic and divination 344.809 - and the belief that certain animals-- 346.559 - especially cats\u2014had divine power. 349.449 - And yes, I did bring that up just so I could lolcat. 352.139 - Old Kingdom Egypt was also remarkably literate: 354.129 - They had two forms of writing, hieroglyphics for sacred writing and then demotic script 358.27 - for recording contracts and agreements and other boring stuff. 362.849 - The last thing I want to say about Old Kingdom Egypt; it was ridiculously rich. 365.499 - But then around 2250 BCE there were a series of droughts and Pharaohs started fighting 370.099 - over who should have power and we had an intermediate period. 373.839 - [classic intermission music] 376.02 - Which was followed by the Middle Earth... 378.589 - No, what? The middle kingdom? Ohh. Really? That\u2019s a bummer, Stan. I want it to be the 384.679 - Middle Earth. How awesome would that be? Like right in the middle of Egyptian history, there 388.779 - were Hobbits.... 389.529 - So the Middle Kingdom, which apparently had no Hobbits, restored Pharaonic rule in 2040 394.289 - BCE but with some distinct changes: 396.49 - First, the rulers were outsiders, from downriver in Nubia. Second, they fostered a new pantheon 401.499 - of gods, the star of which was Ammun, which means hidden. 405.319 - So here\u2019s a little lesson from history: Hidden gods tend to do well because they\u2019re omnipresent. 409.969 - So Ammun eventually merged with Ra to form the god Ammun-Ra, who was like the best god ever 414.94 - and all the Middle Kingdom pharaohs made temples for him and devoted all of their surplus to his glory. 421.179 - The Middle Kingdom also developed an interest in conquering, specifically the new homeland 425.469 - of Nubia, and they developed a side interest in getting conquered, specifically by Semitic 430.149 - peoples from the Levant. 431.589 - They were able to conquer much of Egypt using superior military technology like bronze weapons 435.959 - and compound bows, and chariots of fire. What? They were just regular chariots? STAN WHY 441.529 - ARE YOU ALWATS KILLING MY DREAMS? 443.749 - One group, the Hyksos, were able to conquer all of Egypt, but rather than like destroying 448.429 - the Egyptian culture, they just relaxed like the Nile and assimilated into the Egyptians. 453.719 - And the Egyptians adopted their military technology. And then the Egyptians destroyed the Hyksos 458.399 - and expelled them from Egypt. 459.779 - And then by 1550 BCE there was again an Egyptian pharaoh, Ahmosis... 463.779 - ...whose name only sounds like an STD. 465.959 - Anyway, after all this conquering and being conquered, Egypt eventually emerged from its 470.179 - geographically imposed isolationism and, can you cue the New Kingdom Graphic please? 473.96 - There it is! 475.08 - New Kingdom Egypt continued this military expansion but it looked more like an Empire, 478.629 - particularly when they headed south and took over land in an attempt to find gold and slaves. 483.949 - Probably the most expansive of the New Kingdom pharaohs was Hatshepsut, a woman who ruled 488.11 - Egypt for about 22 years. 490.089 - And who expanded Egypt not through military might, but through trade. 494.02 - But most new kingdom pharaohs being dudes, focused on military expansion, which brought 498.339 - Egypt into conflicts with the Assyrians who you\u2019ll remember from last week, 502.11 - And then the Persians, and then Alexander the Great and finally, the Romans. 505.399 - On the whole, Egypt probably would\u2019ve been better off enjoying its geographical isolation 509.709 - and not trying to conquer new territory, but all of Egypt\u2019s friends had jumped off a bridge, so\u2026 514.56 - One last thing about the New Kingdom. There was this crazy New Kingdom Pharaoh named Akehenaten, 518.709 - who tried to invent a new god for Egypt, Aten. 522.169 - Akehenaten was kind of the Kim Jong Il of Ancient Egypt, like he had this feared police 526.129 - force and this big cult of personality. And also he was a nut job. 530.16 - Anyway, after his death he was replaced by his wife, and then a daughter and than a son, 535.209 - Tutankaten, who turned his back on the weird god Aten and changed his name to Tutankhamen. 541.44 - And that is about all King Tut did before he died... 544.629 - ...probably around the age of 17. Honestly, the only reason King Tut is famous is that 549.47 - most Pharaohs had their graves robbed by ancient people; and King Tut had his grave robbed 555.019 - by 20th century British people. 556.829 - Which brings us to the Open Letter. 562.72 - An Open Letter to King Tut: 564.42 - Oh, but first we gotta find out what Stan left for me in the Secret Compartment. It\u2019s a pen. 570.38 - AAHHHH!! It\u2019s a shock pen! Stan?%@# 573.55 - That\u2019s a terrible, terrible gift for the secret compartment. 577.44 - Dear King Tut, I know that as Pharaohs lives go, yours was pretty poor. First, you had to marry your 582.91 - sister, which hopefully you weren\u2019t that psyched about, plus you had a cleft palette 586.87 - and probably scoliosis. 589.04 - Plus you died before really reaching adulthood. But dude, you have had the best afterlife ever. 593.98 - Since your body was discovered in 1922, you\u2019ve become probably the most famous ancient person. 599.019 - There have been lots of books about you, scholars have devoted their lives to you. 603.459 - Dude, we\u2019re so obsessed with you that we used this fancy new technology to scan your 606.74 - body and establish that you probably died of an infected broken leg and/or malaria, 611.509 - So you\u2019ve inspired such seminal works of art as the Discovery Kids series Tutenstein, 616.069 - which my son forces me to watch. 617.769 - Your relics have been to six continents! So it all works out in the end, man. 622.36 - Well, I mean, you\u2019re still dead. So that\u2019s kinda sucks. 626.02 - Best wishes, John Green 627.8 - King Tut leads us nicely to the really crucial thing about Egyptian culture. 631.47 - Because King Tut lived right around the same time as the pyramids right? Wrong. 634.939 - Remember the pyramids were built around 2500 BCE during the Old Kingdom. King Tut died 641.36 - in 1322 BCE, 1200 years later! 644.54 - That\u2019s five and a half Americas. But because Egypt was so similar for so long, it all tends 650.319 - to blend together when we imagine it. 652.879 - Ancient Egypt lasted 1000 years longer than Christianity has been around, and about 800 657.329 - years longer than that other super-long lived civilization, China. 660.779 - So there was an entire culture that lasted longer than Western Civilization has existed 665.81 - and it had run its course before \u201cthe West\u201d was even born. 668.8 - Next week, we\u2019ll look at the Persians and the Greeks. I\u2019ll see you then. 674.99 - Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller; The show is written by Raoul Meyer 679.149 - my high school history teacher and myself; our script supervisor is Danica Johnson and 683.36 - our graphics team is Thought Bubble. 685.04 - Last week\u2019s phrase of the week was \u201cMale Models.\u201d You can take your guess at this 688.439 - week\u2019s phrase of the week in Comments and also suggest future phrases of the week. 692.72 - And if you have any questions about today\u2019s video, leave them in Comments and our team 696.49 - of semi-professional quasi-historians will endeavor to answer them as best we can. 700.649 - Thanks for watching and as we say in my hometown: Don\u2019t forget to be awesome."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Exploring Ancient Egypt 0:36 - Why Egypt is Iconic 1:08 - The Importance of the Nile 2:10 - Egyptian History: Key Periods 2:43 - The Old Kingdom and the Pyramids 3:56 - The Middle Kingdom: Changes and Challenges 5:09 - The New Kingdom and Expansion 6:25 - King Tut: The Iconic Pharaoh 7:28 - Egypt's Longevity and Legacy 8:38 - Closing Thoughts and Next Week's Topic"}]}

And no, we're not going to be talking about 11.04 - the laws of thermo-dynamics. That's Hank's show. Though we will be bringing the heat, ha! 15.23 - The law affects you even if you never committed a crime because there's so much more to the legal 18.66 - system than just criminal justice, and even though we're going to focus mainly on courts, the law is everywhere. 23.82 - If you don't believe me, read the user license on your next new piece of software, or if 27.38 - you fly anywhere read the back of your plane ticket. Hopefully won't be more entertaining 31.12 - than what you're watching now, but that's examples of the law. 34.14 - [Theme Music] 43.12 - In general, courts have three basic functions, only one of which you probably learned about in 47.16 - your history class. The first thing that courts do is settle disputes. In pre-modern history 51.09 - (which is way easier to understand than post-modern history), kings performed this function, but 55.03 - as states got bigger and more powerful it became much easier to have specialized officials 58.75 - decide important issues like who owned the fox you caught on someone else's land. Or 62.52 - what does the fox say, which was disputed a lot back then. 66.22 - The second thing the courts do is probably the one you heard about in school, or on television, 69.909 - or perhaps while studying for the standardized test, and that's interpret the laws. This 73.569 - becomes increasingly important when you actually try to read laws, or when you realize that 76.63 - legislators are often not as they might be when writing laws in the first place. Take a look at the 80.92 - Affordable Care Act. There are a few famous careless errors in that. 83.93 - Finally courts create expectations for future actions. This is very important if you want 87.42 - to do business with someone. If you know that you'll be punished for cheating a potential 90.47 - business client, you're less likely to do it. Still you might, 'cause there are a lot 94.31 - of jerks out there who would. Are you one of them? Don't be! At the same time if you 97.9 - know that people will be punished for cheating you you're more likely to do business. And 101.11 - it's courts that create the expectation that business will be conducted fairly. 104.28 - Interpreting the laws can help this too, since the interpretations are public and they set 107.63 - expectations that everyone can understand and know what the law means and how it applies 111.97 - and then world peace. No more law breaking ever. 114.64 - The first thing to remember about courts in the U.S. is that most legal action, if it 117.74 - occurs in court at all, occurs in state court. And if it occurs at night, it occurs in Night Court. 122.24 - Because this is mainly a series about federal government, and not Indiana government 125.46 - or sitcoms about court in New York, I'm going to focus mainly on the federal court system 129.5 - which has four main characteristics. 130.95 - One, the federal court system is separate from the other branches of government. The 134.11 - executive could do the job, just like kings used to but we have separation of powers so 138.0 - we don't have to be at the mercy of kings. Have you seen Game of Thrones? 140.9 - Two, the federal courts are hierarchical, with the Supreme Court at the top and turtles 144.379 - all the way down. Nope -- not turtles -- sorry I meant lower courts. What this means is that 147.79 - when a lower court makes a decision it can be appealed to a higher court that can either 151.15 - affirm or overturn the lower court's decision. 153.43 - The third feature of federal courts is that they are able to perform judicial review over 156.64 - laws passed by Congress and state legislatures, and over executive actions. 160.349 - And the fourth aspect of federal court system is that you should know that the federal judges 163.59 - are appointed for life, and their salaries can't be reduced. This is to preserve their 167.12 - independence from politics. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal. 169.8 - Remember when I told you that the legislature makes the laws? Well, that was true, but it's 173.519 - also not the whole story. Legislatures both state and national make laws and these written 177.489 - laws are called statutes. In continental Europe those are pretty much all the laws they have. Statutes. 181.7 - Statutes everywhere! And statues. That place is filled with art. They had the Renaissance there, y'know? 186.29 - But in the U.S. and England, which is where we got the idea, we have something called 189.55 - common law, which consists of the past decisions of courts that influence future legal decisions. 193.659 - The key to common law is the idea that a prior court decision sets a precedent that constrains 197.55 - future courts. Basically if one court makes a decision, all other courts in the same jurisdiction 201.81 - have to apply that decision, whether they like it or not. The collection of those decisions 205.54 - by judges becomes the common law. 209.98 - I don't have to have a reason to punch the eagle. 211.92 - I should probably point out what courts actually do and explain that there are two different 214.739 - types of courts that can make civil law. What differentiates the two types of courts is 218.26 - their jurisdiction, which basically means the set of cases that they're authorized to decide. 222.2 - Trial courts are also called courts of original jurisdiction. These are the ones you see on 225.59 - TV and they actually do two things. First, they hear evidence and determine what actually 229.51 - happened when there's a dispute. This is called deciding the facts of the case. Not everything 233.08 - that happened or that may be important qualifies as a fact in a court case. Those are determined 237.03 - by the rules of evidence, which are complicated and would really slow down an episode of Law and Order. 241.06 - After the trial court hears the facts of a case it decides the outcome by applying the 244.54 - relevant law. What law they apply will depend on statutes and in some cases what other courts 248.709 - have said in similar situations. In other words the common law. 251.73 - You might have noticed that I've been referring to courts, not judges or juries, because not 255.06 - all trials have juries. Bench trials have only a judge who determines the facts and 258.799 - the law. Besides, who decides what in a court case isn't really that important. More than 262.43 - 90% of cases never go to court by the way, they just get settled by lawyers out of court. 266.13 - But say you actually go to court and you lose. Naturally, you'd be upset. 270.04 - Especially if you're a sore loser, like me. Shut up. 274.42 - You have a choice. You can give up and go back to your normal, loser life or you can 277.84 - appeal the trial court decision to a higher court. An appeals court that has, you guessed 281.78 - it, appellate jurisdiction. Did you actually guess that? That'd be amazing. 285.74 - Appeals courts don't hear facts -- who wants those -- they just decide questions of law 289.49 - so you don't have to bring witnesses or present evidence, just arguments. In most cases, if 293.16 - you want to bring a successful appeal, you need to show that there was something wrong 295.83 - with the procedure of your trial. Maybe the judge allowed the jury to hear evidence they 298.88 - shouldn't have heard, maybe one of the jurors was a cyborg. 301.28 - Here's the way that these courts connect to what I was saying before about common and 303.9 - statutory law. Most common law is made by appeals courts. And because appeals courts have 308.03 - larger jurisdiction than trial courts, appeals decisions are much more important than trial court decisions. 312.86 - So now I'm going to talk about the three types of law, and it's gonna get confusing. We should 316.07 - probably go to the Thought Bubble for some nice, compelling, intriguing animations. 320.1 - The two main types of law are basically the Bruce Banner of law. They're the criminal 323.41 - law and civil law, but they can sometimes morph into the Incredible Hulk of laws: public law. 329.17 - \"Public law, smash abuse of government authority!\" 332.29 - If you watch TV or movies, or read John Grisham novels, you're probably familiar with criminal law. 336.28 - Criminal laws are almost always statutes written by legislatures, which means that 339.47 - there is an actual law for you to break. In most states the criminal laws are called the 342.87 - penal codes. In a criminal dispute -- and it's a dispute because the government says you 346.259 - broke the law and you will say you didn't -- the government is called the prosecution and 349.58 - the person accused of committing the crime is called the defendant. 352.41 - Almost all criminal cases happen at the state level and for this reason it's hard to know 355.37 - exactly what is or what is not a crime in each state. Although murder is a crime everywhere. 359.27 - There are also some federal crimes like tax evasion, mail fraud, and racketeering. 362.75 - If you're suing someone or being sued, you're in the realm of civil law. Civil cases arise 366.59 - from disputes between individuals, or between individuals and the government, when one party, 370.43 - the plaintiff, claims that the other party, the defendant, has caused an injury that can 373.61 - be fixed or remedied. If the plaintiff proves his or her case the defendant must pay damages. 377.74 - If you lose a civil case you don't go to prison or jail in most circumstances, but you may 381.06 - end up losing lots of money, and that sucks. I love money. 384.36 - Cases about contracts, property, and personal injuries, also called torts, are examples 388.419 - of civil law. So under certain circumstances a civil or criminal case can become public law. 392.52 - This happens when either the defendant or plaintiff can show that the powers of government 395.759 - or the rights of citizens under the Constitution or federal law is involved in the case. 399.56 - Also if the law gets exposed to gamma rays. \"Law, smash!\" 402.98 - For example, in a criminal case where the defendant claims that the civil rights were 405.88 - violated by the police, the decision can become public law. Thanks Thought Bubble. 409.569 - So those are the basics of the court system in the U.S. And you can see that there's a 412.47 - lot to keep straight. There are types of courts, basically trial courts and appeals courts, 416.139 - on both the state and federal level. And there are types of laws, basically statutory and common laws. 420.62 - The fact that we have both state and federal statutory law is an example of federalism in action. 424.96 - The U.S. unlike most other nations has both statutory and common law, but most of the 428.69 - time when we're talking about federal laws we're in the realm of statutes, or maybe the Constitution. 432.7 - When you study American government, most of the cases you read about are examples of appeals 436.18 - and of public law. How this all works in practice is even more complicated. And the adaptability 440.449 - of the American legal fabric allows statutes to stretch to fit the growing and changing American society. 445.86 - Much like Bruce Banner's incredibly elastic pants. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time. 452.96 - I'm getting angry! Oh no! Ahhhh! I'm not wearing elastic pants! Oh no!

can I survive Navy SEAL training well the answer is probably no but that's not 4.08 - going to stop me from trying today I'm here at the official training center for 7.259 - Navy SEAL and Swig in Coronado California to see if I can complete the 10.86 - infamous buds obstacle course are you laughing over there no this is where 16.44 - Navy Seals are built and swick and swick come on man 21.42 - today we have one Mission challenge Austin's physical and mental resilience 25.8 - with one goal make him quit welcome to the Navy Seal in swaco thank 31.08 - you things are going to get really intense today 34.5 - I'm ready for it if any point in time it gets too tough feel free to ring the 38.82 - bell and that'll mean that you quit okay thank you thanks for bringing this 43.559 - so close to this course of course means a lot 47.579 - I'll tell you what this video Hits 10 000 likes I'll come out and run through 51.059 - your obstacle course I think we can get this to 10 000 likes 54.0 - you guys please help me out let's do this 57.36 - and then we hug and then I carry you over there that's weird I know 62.16 - so out of all these obstacles which one is the toughest I would have to say the 66.36 - most intimidating obstacle we have on this course would have to be the slide 69.119 - for life because of its height but what the most people fail here on is 73.86 - the rope swing that small one right over there that small one huh because their 79.74 - grips are fatigued by that point is there any type of like danger that I 84.6 - should be worried about yeah you wouldn't want to 87.36 - fall off the top of the cargo net I could have guessed that I don't have a 91.619 - fear of heights though okay when you told me you're most afraid of I know 94.979 - just because it's hot it's uh because my grip I've said I don't want 99.78 - to fall if I fell it would hurt okay let's get into it we have sb1 Jake foins 105.479 - demonstrating and at the start the first obstacle is the parallel bars this is to 110.04 - challenge your upper body strength makes that look pretty easy how many times 113.399 - have you done this obstacle a lot like over a hundred easily over 100. the next 117.6 - obstacle is the low wall where it challenges an operator's ability to 121.079 - bound over High walls in combat 124.68 - the next obstacle is the high wall where it starts to challenge your grip 128.16 - strength and your ability to remain low as you go over obstacles 133.56 - next obstacle is the low crawl oh that's really low look how low that is 138.239 - after the little crawl we move into the cargo net this is our tallest obstacle 141.9 - where most people lose their grip strength the key here is to use your 146.58 - legs that is tall 153.239 - yeah after you finish the cargo net you move 157.14 - to the balance logs I think it's self-explanatory what it teaches balance 160.819 - balance okay look at that [Music] 164.78 - logs next obstacle we have here is the transfer rope you do this twice you do 170.28 - it one time one time oh and then you transfer that's why it's called the 173.58 - transfer rope that's why they call it that this obstacle is called the Dirty 176.819 - name dirty name a lot of people use a dirty name when they do it going over it 182.58 - yeah he made it look pretty easy next obstacle is the Weaver oh this one looks 187.08 - familiar the next obstacle we have here is the 189.9 - Burma Bridge it's designed to replicate the bridges in Burma just so much more 194.879 - balance prepping the mine for the most dangerous obstacle here you ever have 200.28 - anybody fall right here surprisingly enough next up is a slide 205.92 - for life oh so you're climbing up the platforms to get to the actual slide 210.9 - watch your head that's right and right here where you go upside down like that 214.2 - that technique is uh the best balls at the top 224.78 - that was pretty quick next obstacle is the rope swing and this 228.84 - is the one I was telling you it gets most people 238.92 - and then this must be the incline wall how'd you know it's a wall and it's an 243.239 - incline oh plus the sun's there too 248.4 - you ever get any splinters every every now and again every now and again yeah 252.239 - this obstacle is difficult because by the time you get here your grip is so 256.26 - fatigued that holding onto these little Ledges it's really difficult 260.34 - oh man those are small like maybe half an inch 264.36 - foreign 268.04 - the final obstacle is the bolts is the only thing that can touch the log is 273.0 - your hands okay so no legs no head no butt no butt and the last three you 279.9 - gotta say who yeah of course at the Finish touch a sign of course 50 285.24 - push-ups is that something y'all really do or are you just at it is okay 291.38 - yeah of course so Austin after seeing us demonstrate every obstacle here today 296.94 - what do you think uh I think it's gonna be extremely tough especially the high 300.84 - obstacles and not only are you dealing with the physical barrier of being able 304.199 - to climb those things but the mental barrier of them being so tall uh about 307.979 - halfway through my heart rate will be at 180 190 probably and it's going to take 313.62 - it's gonna take a lot out of me so the passing time at first phase is 12 317.1 - minutes and I'll make you a deal if you pass we'll invite you back for more 321.479 - okay 12 minutes what is your obstacle course 324.78 - time so my PR ever going through this during training was actually six minute 328.979 - 59. every time I get out here I'm usually averaging right around seven 332.52 - minutes 30 seconds that sounds pretty quick 335.46 - it's pretty quick well I'm gonna beat you today 337.44 - I'd like to see that 340.44 -

This episode is supported by Hover. 6.0 - Hi, I'm Carrie Anne, and welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! 9.44 - Computers in the 1940s and early 50s ran one program at a time. 12.74 - A programmer would write one at their desk, for example, on punch cards. 15.559 - Then, they\u2019d carry it to a room containing a room-sized computer, and hand it to a dedicated 19.63 - computer operator. 20.63 - That person would then feed the program into the computer when it was next available. 24.4 - The computer would run it, spit out some output, and halt. 27.14 - This very manual process worked OK back when computers were slow, and running a program 31.73 - often took hours, days or even weeks. 33.621 - But, as we discussed last episode, computers became faster... and faster... and faster 38.76 - \u2013 exponentially so! 39.98 - Pretty soon, having humans run around and inserting programs into readers was taking 43.62 - longer than running the actual programs themselves. 46.149 - We needed a way for computers to operate themselves, and so, operating systems were born. 50.7 - INTRO 59.84 - Operating systems, or OS\u2019es for short, are just programs. 63.14 - But, special privileges on the hardware let them run and manage other programs. 67.08 - They\u2019re typically the first one to start when a computer is turned on, and all subsequent 70.86 - programs are launched by the OS. 72.57 - They got their start in the 1950s, as computers became more widespread and more powerful. 76.98 - The very first OSes augmented the mundane, manual task of loading programs by hand. 81.76 - Instead of being given one program at a time, computers could be given batches. 85.69 - When the computer was done with one, it would automatically and near-instantly start the next. 90.0 - There was no downtime while someone scurried around an office to find the next program 93.52 - to run. 94.53 - This was called batch processing. 96.19 - While computers got faster, they also got cheaper. 98.43 - So, they were popping up all over the world, especially in universities and government 102.33 - offices. 103.33 - Soon, people started sharing software. 105.34 - But there was a problem\u2026 106.83 - In the era of one-off computers, like the Harvard Mark 1 or ENIAC, programmers only 111.14 - had to write code for that one single machine. 113.86 - The processor, punch card readers, and printers were known and unchanging. 118.15 - But as computers became more widespread, their configurations were not always identical, 122.26 - like computers might have the same CPU, but not the same printer. 125.66 - This was a huge pain for programmers. 127.56 - Not only did they have to worry about writing their program, but also how to interface with 131.249 - each and every model of printer, and all devices connected to a computer, what are called peripherals. 136.44 - Interfacing with early peripherals was very low level, requiring programmers to know intimate 140.88 - hardware details about each device. 143.1 - On top of that, programmers rarely had access to every model of a peripheral to test their code on. 147.88 - So, they had to write code as best they could, often just by reading manuals, and hope it 152.06 - worked when shared. 153.069 - Things weren\u2019t exactly plug-and-play back then\u2026 more plug-and-pray. 156.59 - This was clearly terrible, so to make it easier for programmers, Operating Systems stepped 160.84 - in as intermediaries between software programs and hardware peripherals. 165.48 - More specifically, they provided a software abstraction, through APIs, called device drivers. 170.32 - These allow programmers to talk to common input and output hardware, or I/O for short, 174.629 - using standardized mechanisms. 176.43 - For example, programmers could call a function like \u201cprint highscore\u201d, and the OS would 180.129 - do the heavy lifting to get it onto paper. 182.349 - By the end of the 1950s, computers had gotten so fast, they were often idle waiting for 186.29 - slow mechanical things, like printers and punch card readers. 189.829 - While programs were blocked on I/O, the expensive processor was just chillin\u2019... not like 193.939 - a villain\u2026 you know, just relaxing. 195.479 - In the late 50\u2019s, the University of Manchester, in the UK, started work on a supercomputer 199.5 - called Atlas, one of the first in the world. 201.959 - They knew it was going to be wicked fast, so they needed a way to make maximal use of 205.78 - the expensive machine. 206.87 - Their solution was a program called the Atlas Supervisor, finished in 1962. 211.2 - This operating system not only loaded programs automatically, like earlier batch systems, 215.37 - but could also run several at the same time on its single CPU. 219.17 - It did this through clever scheduling. 220.569 - Let\u2019s say we have a game program running on Atlas, and we call the function \u201cprint 224.76 - highscore\u201d which instructs Atlas to print the value of a variable named \u201chighscore\u201d 228.54 - onto paper to show our friends that we\u2019re the ultimate champion of virtual tiddlywinks. 232.609 - That function call is going to take a while, the equivalent of thousands of clock cycles, 237.309 - because mechanical printers are slow in comparison to electronic CPUs. 241.4 - So instead of waiting for the I/O to finish, Atlas instead puts our program to sleep, then 245.98 - selects and runs another program that\u2019s waiting and ready to run. 248.98 - Eventually, the printer will report back to Atlas that it finished printing the value 252.049 - of \u201chighscore\u201d. 253.29 - Atlas then marks our program as ready to go, and at some point, it will be scheduled to 256.93 - run again on the CPU, and continue onto the next line of code following the print statement. 261.69 - In this way, Atlas could have one program running calculations on the CPU, while another 265.98 - was printing out data, and yet another reading in data from a punch tape. 269.76 - Atlas\u2019 engineers doubled down on this idea, and outfitted their computer with 4 paper 274.1 - tape readers, 4 paper tape punches, and up to 8 magnetic tape drives. 278.24 - This allowed many programs to be in progress all at once, sharing time on a single CPU. 283.21 - This ability, enabled by the Operating System, is called multitasking. 286.92 - There\u2019s one big catch to having many programs running simultaneously on a single computer, though. 291.74 - Each one is going to need some memory, and we can\u2019t lose that program\u2019s data when 295.16 - we switch to another program. 296.759 - The solution is to allocate each program its own block of memory. 299.48 - So, for example, let\u2019s say a computer has 10,000 memory locations in total. 304.0 - Program A might get allocated memory addresses 0 through 999, and Program B might get 1000 310.71 - through 1999, and so on. 313.4 - If a program asks for more memory, the operating system decides if it can grant that request, 317.96 - and if so, what memory block to allocate next. 320.59 - This flexibility is great, but introduces a quirk. 323.47 - It means that Program A could end up being allocated non-sequential blocks of memory, 327.729 - in say addresses 0 through 999, and 2000 through 2999. 333.3 - And this is just a simple example - a real program might be allocated dozens of blocks 337.349 - scattered all over memory. 338.65 - As you might imagine, this would get really confusing for programmers to keep track of. 342.56 - Maybe there\u2019s a long list of sales data in memory that a program has to total up at 346.25 - the end of the day, but this list is stored across a bunch of different blocks of memory. 350.05 - To hide this complexity, Operating Systems virtualize memory locations. 354.88 - With Virtual Memory, programs can assume their memory always starts at address 0, keeping 358.86 - things simple and consistent. 360.52 - However, the actual, physical location in computer memory is hidden and abstracted by 364.72 - the operating system. 366.24 - Just a new level of abstraction. 373.96 - Let\u2019s take our example Program B, which has been allocated a block of memory from 377.62 - address 1000 to 1999. 381.08 - As far as Program B can tell, this appears to be a block from 0 to 999. 385.88 - The OS and CPU handle the virtual-to-physical memory remapping automatically. 389.93 - So, if Program B requests memory location 42, it really ends up reading address 1042. 396.25 - This virtualization of memory addresses is even more useful for Program A, which in our 400.319 - example, has been allocated two blocks of memory that are separated from one another. 404.58 - This too is invisible to Program A. 406.75 - As far as it can tell, it\u2019s been allocated a continuous block of 2000 addresses. 411.49 - When Program A reads memory address 999, that does coincidentally map to physical memory 417.039 - address 999. 419.009 - But if Program A reads the very next value in memory, at address 1000, that gets mapped 423.469 - behind the scenes to physical memory address 2000. 426.319 - This mechanism allows programs to have flexible memory sizes, called dynamic memory allocation, 431.58 - that appear to be continuous to them. 433.9 - It simplifies everything and offers tremendous flexibility to the Operating System in running 438.26 - multiple programs simultaneously. 440.1 - Another upside of allocating each program its own memory, is that they\u2019re better isolated 443.87 - from one another. 444.87 - So, if a buggy program goes awry, and starts writing gobbledygook, it can only trash its 448.9 - own memory, not that of other programs. 451.66 - This feature is called Memory Protection. 453.84 - This is also really useful in protecting against malicious software, like viruses. 457.93 - For example, we generally don\u2019t want other programs to have the ability to read or modify 461.71 - the memory of, let say, our email, with that kind of access, malware could send emails 465.72 - on your behalf and maybe steal personal information. 468.52 - Not good! 469.3 - Atlas had both virtual and protected memory. 471.66 - It was the first computer and OS to support these features! 474.56 - By the 1970s, computers were sufficiently fast and cheap. 478.08 - Institutions like a university could buy a computer and let students use it. 482.409 - It was not only fast enough to run several programs at once, but also give several users 486.979 - simultaneous, interactive access. 489.479 - This was done through a terminal, which is a keyboard and screen that connects to a big 493.55 - computer, but doesn\u2019t contain any processing power itself. 496.41 - A refrigerator-sized computer might have 50 terminals connected to it, allowing up to 501.11 - 50 users. 502.11 - Now operating systems had to handle not just multiple programs, but also multiple users. 507.039 - So that no one person could gobble up all of a computer's resources, operating systems 510.889 - were developed that offered time-sharing. 512.659 - With time-sharing each individual user was only allowed to utilize a small fraction of 517.27 - the computer\u2019s processor, memory, and so on. 519.86 - Because computers are so fast, even getting just 1/50th of its resources was enough for 524.63 - individuals to complete many tasks. 525.75 - The most influential of early time-sharing Operating Systems was Multics, or Multiplexed 530.34 - Information and Computing Service, released in 1969. 534.08 - Multics was the first major operating system designed to be secure from the outset. 538.52 - Developers didn\u2019t want mischievous users accessing data they shouldn't, like students 542.64 - attempting to access the final exam on their professor\u2019s account. 545.74 - Features like this meant Multics was really complicated for its time, using around 1 Megabit 550.27 - of memory, which was a lot back then! 552.269 - That might be half of a computer's memory, just to run the OS! 555.84 - Dennis Ritchie, one of the researchers working on Multics, once said: 558.93 - \u201cOne of the obvious things that went wrong with Multics as a commercial success was just 563.2 - that it was sort of over-engineered in a sense. 565.209 - There was just too much in it.\u201d 566.79 - T his lead Dennis, and another Multics researcher, 568.92 - Ken Thompson, to strike out on their own and build a new, lean operating system\u2026 called Unix. 573.64 - They wanted to separate the OS into two parts: 576.24 - First was the core functionality of the OS, things like memory management, multitasking, 580.52 - and dealing with I/O, which is called the kernel. 583.33 - The second part was a wide array of useful tools that came bundled with, but not part 587.26 - of the kernel, things like programs and libraries. 589.78 - Building a compact, lean kernel meant intentionally leaving some functionality out. 593.47 - Tom Van Vleck, another Multics developer, recalled: 595.84 - \u201cI remarked to Dennis that easily half the code I was writing in Multics was error recovery 600.54 - code.\" 601.28 - He said, \"We left all that stuff out of Unix. 603.74 - If there's an error, we have this routine called panic, and when it is called, the machine 607.87 - crashes, and you holler down the hall, 'Hey, reboot it.'\"\u201d 611.019 - You might have heard of kernel panics, This is where the term came from. 614.14 - It\u2019s literally when the kernel crashes, has no recourse to recover, and so calls a 618.459 - function called \u201cpanic\u201d. 619.94 - Originally, all it did was print the word \u201cpanic\u201d and then enter 622.95 - an infinite loop. 624.03 - This simplicity meant that Unix could be run on cheaper and more diverse hardware, making 628.12 - it popular inside Bell Labs, where Dennis and Ken worked. 631.12 - As more developers started using Unix to build and run their own programs, the number of 634.82 - contributed tools grew. 636.32 - Soon after its release in 1971, it gained compilers for different programming languages 641.0 - and even a word processor, quickly making it one of the most popular OSes of the 1970s 645.51 - and 80s. 646.529 - At the same time, by the early 1980s, the cost of a basic computer had fallen to the 650.68 - point where individual people could afford one, called a personal or home computer. 655.019 - These were much simpler than the big mainframes found at universities, corporations, and governments. 659.48 - So, their operating systems had to be equally simple. 662.24 - For example, Microsoft\u2019s Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was just 160 kilobytes, 667.769 - allowing it to fit, as the name suggests, onto a single disk. 670.589 - First released in 1981, it became the most popular OS for early home computers, even 675.171 - though it lacked multitasking and protected memory. 678.65 - This meant that programs could, and would, regularly crash the system. 682.24 - While annoying, it was an acceptable tradeoff, as users could just turn their own computers 686.4 - off and on again! 687.12 - Even early versions of Windows, first released by Microsoft in 1985 and which dominated the 692.06 - OS scene throughout the 1990s, lacked strong memory protection. 695.64 - When programs misbehaved, you could get the blue screen of death, a sign that a program 700.08 - had crashed so badly that it took down the whole operating system. 703.589 - Luckily, newer versions of Windows have better protections and usually don't crash that often. 708.32 - Today, computers run modern operating systems, like Mac OS X, Windows 10, Linux, iOS and 713.1 - Android. 714.3 - Even though the computers we own are most often used by just a single person, you! their 718.74 - OSes all have multitasking and virtual and protected memory. 722.22 - So, they can run many programs at once: you can watch YouTube in your web browser, edit 726.269 - a photo in Photoshop, play music in Spotify and sync Dropbox all at the same time. 732.259 - This wouldn\u2019t be possible without those decades of research and development on Operating 736.089 - Systems, and of course the proper memory to store those programs. 739.59 - Which we\u2019ll get to next week. 741.2 - I\u2019d like to thank Hover for sponsoring this episode. 744.08 - Hover is a service that helps you buy and manage domain names. 747.16 - Hover has over 400 domain extensions to end your domain with -

asking him what tool he planned on learning first\u00a0 and his answer was python and i asked why python\u00a0\u00a0 26.0 - and he says because it's the hottest tool right\u00a0 now and everyone is talking about it so i know\u00a0\u00a0 31.28 - there's a lot of buzz around learning python to\u00a0 be a data analyst and it's easy to get carried\u00a0\u00a0 36.4 - away with that buzz but try not to get carried\u00a0 away rather you want to see through the noise\u00a0\u00a0 41.68 - and find a tool that suits your style and then\u00a0 you can gradually build competence around that\u00a0\u00a0 47.28 - too so i'm going to provide some options to some\u00a0 resources which are going to be free extremely\u00a0\u00a0 52.96 - beginner friendly and i'm going to focus on the\u00a0 core competencies to get you started generally\u00a0\u00a0 58.64 - there are four main areas to build competence\u00a0 in data analysis and very broadly i list them as\u00a0\u00a0 64.8 - data querying that are cleaning analyzing data\u00a0 using statistical or non-statistical methods\u00a0\u00a0 71.04 - and data visualizations so as a data analyst\u00a0 you'll be required to be knowledgeable using\u00a0\u00a0 76.56 - one or a combination of microsoft excel\u00a0 sql tableau or power bi python or r 89.2 - the reason why microsoft excel is first on\u00a0 the list is because if you work in a corporate\u00a0\u00a0 93.6 - organization or plan to work in a corporate\u00a0 organization most of the data analysis tasks\u00a0\u00a0 99.36 - you will do will be on microsoft excel typically\u00a0 your colleagues will send you an excel file\u00a0\u00a0 104.16 - to work with and it might be unnecessary\u00a0 and sometimes inconvenient to switch\u00a0\u00a0 109.2 - into python to do an analysis that can be\u00a0 done using excel as a beginner data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 114.0 - it is important to learn microsoft excel\u00a0 and you should really be aiming to become\u00a0\u00a0 118.72 - knowledgeable in areas involving the use of\u00a0 salt and filter vlookups pivot tables formulas\u00a0\u00a0 125.68 - and basic data cleaning methods to master excel\u00a0 for an absolute beginner here are the courses\u00a0\u00a0 131.84 - i would recommend introduction to data analysis\u00a0 using excel you'll find this course on edx it's\u00a0\u00a0 138.0 - a free course for four weeks where you learn\u00a0 how to use pivot tables aggregate functions\u00a0\u00a0 144.0 - in basic knowledge of formulas cell referencing\u00a0 and many more after taking this course then you\u00a0\u00a0 150.08 - can jump into the next course which is also an edx\u00a0 which is analyzing and visualizing data with excel\u00a0\u00a0 156.72 - here you'll learn how to import data from\u00a0 different sources using power query manipulate\u00a0\u00a0 162.4 - your data using dax formulas and prepare for data\u00a0 analysis into power bi one major limitation with\u00a0\u00a0 168.64 - excel is it's limited to one million rows of\u00a0 data so when working with large set of data it\u00a0\u00a0 173.6 - starts to become slow and might crash on you a\u00a0 few times but if your job does not require huge\u00a0\u00a0 179.12 - data set then microsoft excel is good enough\u00a0 nonetheless i cannot deny the huge demand for\u00a0\u00a0 184.96 - data analysts with sql and tablet skills so i\u00a0 get the need for picking those skills up as well 195.68 - sql is a language that lets you as a\u00a0 data analyst interact with a database\u00a0\u00a0 199.84 - a database is a collection of\u00a0 data stored in a computer system\u00a0\u00a0 203.76 - usually large volumes of data where accessing\u00a0 it requires some form of structured coding\u00a0\u00a0 209.12 - as a data analyst you might be required to\u00a0 run sql queries and to do so you must first\u00a0\u00a0 214.72 - understand the basis of relational database\u00a0 and structure specifically things like primary\u00a0\u00a0 220.56 - key foreign key relationships between tables\u00a0 then you go ahead and learn sql functions like\u00a0\u00a0 227.2 - select statement from statement where statement\u00a0 group by order by joins area you want to master\u00a0\u00a0 235.12 - for learning sql again you can check out this edx\u00a0 course on sql it's called sql for data science\u00a0\u00a0 242.08 - alternatively you can check out khan academy's sql\u00a0 course called intro to sql querying and managing 249.76 - data the third competence to learn is either one\u00a0 of tab u or power bi i just finished learning\u00a0\u00a0 260.16 - tableau and what i discovered was it's not so much\u00a0 different from power bi you do basically the same\u00a0\u00a0 266.72 - thing which is to visualize large data sets and\u00a0 the cool thing about both 2 is you can import\u00a0\u00a0 273.2 - your data directly from sql or a csv file or\u00a0 any other database to create your visualizations\u00a0\u00a0 280.32 - at this point because you're already\u00a0 familiar with visualizations using excel\u00a0\u00a0 285.36 - it becomes super easy to understand how\u00a0 to use either one of tablet or power bi\u00a0\u00a0 290.4 - to learn power bi once again head over to edx\u00a0 enroll for the analyzing and visualizing data with\u00a0\u00a0 297.28 - power bi costs in this course you'll\u00a0 learn how to identify different types\u00a0\u00a0 301.36 - of data visualizations and how to create\u00a0 fully functional reports and dashboards\u00a0\u00a0 310.8 - now finally python as a data analyst python is\u00a0 used to manipulate data similar to what you do\u00a0\u00a0 317.52 - on sql python is also used in data science for\u00a0 highly mathematical and statistical analysis when\u00a0\u00a0 325.28 - using python what you're really learning is how to\u00a0 use statistics to analyze data remember my friend\u00a0\u00a0 331.76 - who's learning how to use python so far he's\u00a0 gotten a hang of some of the theoretical concepts\u00a0\u00a0 337.68 - however there is the practical side which he is\u00a0 currently struggling with and by practical side\u00a0\u00a0 343.04 - i mean how do you know what sort of problems or\u00a0 challenges that should be solved using statistics\u00a0\u00a0 350.16 - not all analysis requires statistics and that's\u00a0 something you must be aware of as a data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 356.0 - so some of the basic statistical concepts\u00a0 you should be aware of or you should know\u00a0\u00a0 360.88 - are sampling frequency distribution mean media\u00a0 mode measures of variability standard deviation\u00a0\u00a0 368.32 - probability significant testing z-scores\u00a0 confidence intervals and a b testing all these\u00a0\u00a0 375.04 - can be learned and practiced using microsoft excel\u00a0 data analysis 2-pack even before picking up python\u00a0\u00a0 381.6 - class so if you ask me learning python is quite\u00a0 optional which is the whole essence of this video\u00a0\u00a0 389.04 - i do not want people to feel they have to learn\u00a0 python or r to become data analyst trust me i know\u00a0\u00a0 395.68 - data analysts that have worked solely on excel\u00a0 and they are fine even right now as a data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 401.28 - most of the work that i do is a microsoft excel\u00a0 and to really show you this here is a data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 406.48 - role on Andela Andela is a renowned technology\u00a0 slash i.t talent pool company in Africa and\u00a0\u00a0 413.2 - let's jump straight to the requirements for this\u00a0 role here you have must have deep understanding\u00a0\u00a0 418.32 - of statistics have strong excel skills have\u00a0 experience with sql and database management\u00a0\u00a0 425.2 - have experience with any statistical analysis\u00a0 package such as excel spss and sas so the bottom\u00a0\u00a0 433.2 - line is you can be a data analyst with the\u00a0 simple tools at your disposal start with excel\u00a0\u00a0 439.68 - move over to sql if you need to try\u00a0 your hands on different visualizations\u00a0\u00a0 444.08 - tab your power bi if you're really curious and\u00a0 you want to take it a step higher by all means use\u00a0\u00a0 449.44 - python at the end of the day as long as you can\u00a0 use the tool to get the job done then fantastic 459.36 - you must find ways to apply your knowledge in\u00a0 specific projects to deepen your experience\u00a0\u00a0 464.16 - and showcase your skills without projects you will\u00a0 not be able to retain what you've learned for long\u00a0\u00a0 469.92 - cargo.com is one place to download some\u00a0 data sets and play around with them\u00a0\u00a0 474.32 - apply the knowledge you've learned and experiment\u00a0 with different visualizations it will help\u00a0\u00a0 478.96 - increase your confidence levels significantly\u00a0 all right if you have any questions do leave\u00a0\u00a0 483.44 - them down in the comment section below i'd\u00a0 be happy to answer them and if this video\u00a0\u00a0 487.68 - has been helpful to you in any way do smash\u00a0 the like button so that others can benefit\u00a0\u00a0 492.72 - as well thanks for watching and\u00a0 i'll see you in the next one"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

For instance, you probably know what this is and what this is, you probably 17.4 - don\u2019t know what that is. Google it. 20.11 - Mr. Green Mr. Green why do you think people know so little about Islamic history? 23.76 - Did you just ask an interesting non-annoying question, me from the past? I think we don\u2019t 28.45 - know about early Islamic history because we don\u2019t learn about it, me from the past, 32.02 - because we don\u2019t learn about it, because we\u2019re taught that our history is the story 34.78 - of Christianity in Europe, when in fact our history is the story of people on the planet, 41.54 - so let\u2019s try to learn something today. 43.3 - [theme music] 51.86 - So in less than 200 years Islam went from not existing to being the religious and political 56.96 - organizing principal of one of the largest empires in the world. 60.639 - And that story begins in the 7th century CE when the angel Gabriel appeared to Muhammad, 65.1 - a 40-ish guy who made his living as a caravan trader and told him to begin reciting the word of God. 70.84 - Initially, this freaked Muhammad out, as, you know, it would\u2014but then his wife and 74.54 - a couple of other people encouraged him and slowly he came to accept the mantle as prophet. 78.8 - A few things to know about the world Islam entered: First, Muhammad\u2019s society was intensely 83.29 - tribal. He was a member of the Quraysh tribe, living in Mecca and tribal ties were extremely important. 88.82 - Also, at the time, the Arabian peninsula was like this crazy religious melting pot. Like 93.09 - most tribal Arabs worshipped gods very similar to the Mesopotamian gods you\u2019ll remember from episode 3. 99.37 - And by the time of Muhammad, cult statutes of many of those gods had been collected in 103.0 - his hometown of Mecca in this temple-like structure called the Kaaba. 107.04 - But Arabia was also a home for monotheisms like Christianity and Judaism, even a bit 110.69 - of Zoroastrianism. So the message that there was only god wouldn\u2019t have been like as 115.84 - surprising to Muhammad as it was, for instance, to Abraham. 119.0 - Also, and this will become very important, the northern part of Arabia was sandwiched 122.53 - between the Byzantine Empire and the Persian Sassanian Empire\u2014and you\u2019ll remember, 127.03 - those guys were always fighting. They were like snowboarders and skiers, or like the 132.08 - Westboro Baptist Church and everyone else. 134.97 - At its core, Islam is what we call a radical reforming religion\u2014just like Jesus and Moses 139.63 - sought to restore Abrahamic monotheism after what they perceived as straying, so too did Muhammad. 145.05 - Muslims believe that God sent Muhammad as the final prophet to bring people back to 149.2 - the one true religion, which involves the worship of, and submission to, a single and all-powerful God. 156.1 - The Quran also acknowledges Abraham and Moses and Jesus among others as prophets, but it\u2019s 160.23 - very different from the Hebrew and Christian bibles: 162.36 - For one thing it\u2019s much less narrative, but also its 164.3 - the written record of the revelations Muhammad received\u2014which means its not written from 168.11 - the point of view of people, it is seen as the actual word of God. 172.209 - The Quran is a really broad-ranging text, but it returns again and again to a couple 175.64 - themes. One is strict monotheism and the other is the importance of taking care of those 181.03 - less fortunate than you. The Quran, says of the good person 184.02 - spends his substance\u2014however much he himself may cherish it\u2014upon his near of kin, and 188.61 - the orphans, and the needy, and the wayfarer, and the beggars, and for the freeing of human 193.56 - beings from bondage. 194.99 - These revelations also radically increased the rights of women and orphans, which was 198.79 - one of the reasons why Mohammad\u2019s tribal leaders weren\u2019t that psyched about them. 202.59 - To talk more about Islamic faith and practice, let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 205.2 - The five pillars of Islam are the basic acts considered obligatory, at least by Sunni Muslims. 209.77 - First is the shahada or the profession of the faith: 212.44 - There is no god but god and Muhammad is God\u2019s prophet, which is sometimes translated as 217.3 - \u201cThere is no god but Allah and Muhammad is Allah\u2019s prophet\u201d, which tries to make 220.79 - Muslims sound other and ignores the fact that the Arabic word for god\u2014whether you are 224.77 - Christian or Jewish or Muslim\u2014is Allah. 227.28 - Second, salat, or ritual prayer five times a day\u2014at dawn, noon, afternoon, sunset, 233.67 - and late evening\u2014which are obligatory unless you haven\u2019t hit puberty, are too sick, or 238.31 - are menstruating. Keep it PG, Thought Bubble. 240.93 - Third, sawm, the month-long fast during the month of Ramadan, in which Muslims do not 244.989 - eat or drink or smoke cigarettes during daylight hours. 248.239 - Since Ramadan is a lunar-calendar month, it moves around the seasons, and obviously it\u2019s 252.76 - most fun during the winter, when days are shorter, and least fun during the summer, 256.78 - when days are both long and hot. 259.1 - Fourth is zakat, or almsgiving, in which non-poor Muslims are required to give a percentage 263.6 - of their income to the poor, 265.47 - and lastly hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims must try to fulfill at least once 270.68 - in their lives, provided they are healthy and have enough money. 273.66 - And there\u2019s also more to understanding Islam than just knowing the Quran. Like Judaism 277.03 - with its Talmud, and Christianity with its lives of saints and writings of Church fathers, 281.98 - Islam has supplementary sacred texts, chief among which is the hadith, a collection of 286.889 - sayings and stories about the Prophet. 289.23 - Thanks Thought Bubble. Oh, it\u2019s time for the open letter? 294.74 - Magic. 295.56 - An Open Letter to the 72 Virgins. Oh, but first let\u2019s check what\u2019s in the Secret 299.46 - Compartment. Huh, it\u2019s Andre the Giant. Did you know that Andre the Giant died a virgin- 305.52 - is a fact that I made up? 306.84 - Dear 72 Virgins, 308.1 - Hey there, it\u2019s me, John Green. Did you know that not all hadiths were created equal? 312.4 - Some sayings of the Prophet are really well sourced. like for instance, a good friend 316.33 - or a relative heard the Prophet say something and then it ended up as a hadith. 320.669 - But some hadiths are terribly sourced like, not to be irreverent, but some of it is like 323.41 - middle school gossip; like Rachel told Rebekah that her sister\u2019s brother\u2019s friend kissed 329.27 - Justin Bieber on the face. 330.41 - And the vast majority of Muslims don\u2019t treat terribly sourced hadiths as scripture. 334.199 - And the idea that you go to heaven and get 72 virgins is not in the Quran; it\u2019s in 337.87 - a terribly sourced hadith so it is my great regret to inform you, 72 Virgins, that in 343.02 - the eyes of almost all Muslims you do not exist. 347.1 - Best wishes, John Green 348.63 - One more thing about Islam: Like Christianity and Judaism, it has a body of law. You might 353.32 - have heard of it - it\u2019s called sharia. 355.169 - Although we tend to think of sharia as this single set of laws that all Muslims follow, 359.229 - that\u2019s ridiculous; there are numerous competing interpretations of sharia, just as there are 363.68 - within any legal tradition. 365.229 - So people who embraced this worldview were called Muslims, because they submitted to 368.46 - the will of God, and they became part of the umma, or community of believers. 372.919 - This would be a good moment for an Uma Thurman joke, but sadly she is no longer famous. I\u2019m 377.12 - sorry if you\u2019re watching this, Uma Thurman. 379.58 - Being part of the umma trumped all other ties, including tribal ties, which got Muhammad 384.22 - into some trouble and brings us, at last, back to history. 387.78 - So as Muhammad\u2019s following in Mecca grew, the umma aroused the suspicion of the most 391.12 - powerful tribe, the Quraysh. 393.6 - And it didn\u2019t matter that Muhammad himself was born into the Quraysh tribe because he 396.729 - wouldn\u2019t shut up about how there was only one God, which was really bad news to the 401.07 - Quraysh tribe because they managed the pilgrimage trade in Mecca, and if all those gods were 406.29 - false, it would be a disaster economically. 409.0 - \u2014although come to think of it, in the end the Meccan pilgrimage business turned out just fine. 412.919 - So the Quraysh forced Muhammad and his followers out of Mecca in 622 CE, and they headed to 418.27 - Yithrab, also known as Medina. 420.46 - This journey, also know as the hijra, is so important that it marks year 0 in the Islamic calendar. 425.6 - In Medina, Muhammad severed the religion\u2019s ties to Judaism, turning the focus of prayer 429.77 - away from Jerusalem to Mecca. 432.12 - Also in Medina, the Islamic community started to look a lot more like a small empire than 436.34 - like a church. Like, Jesus never had a country to run. 439.59 - But Muhammad did almost from the beginning. And in addition to being an important prophet, 443.25 - he was a good general and in 630, the Islamic community took back Mecca. 447.9 - They destroyed the idols in the kabaa, and soon Islam was as powerful a political force 452.18 - in the region as it was a religious one. 454.07 - And it\u2019s because the political and religious coexisted from the beginning, that there\u2019s 457.449 - no separate tradition of civic and religious law like there is in Christianity and Judaism. 461.539 - very different from Judaism and even from Christianity\u2014which you\u2019ll remember debated 462.08 - very different from Judaism and even from Christianity\u2014which you\u2019ll remember debated 462.539 - for generations whether to be inclusive. 462.58 - \u2014and more importantly than separating Islam from other monotheisms, that really separated 462.6 - Islam from the tribalism in Arabia. 462.66 - So then when Muhammad died in 632 CE, there wasn\u2019t a religious vacuum left behind: Muhammad 467.229 - was the final prophet, the revelation of the Quran would continue to guide the umma throughout their lives. 473.41 - But the community did need a political leader, a caliph. And the first caliph was Abu Bakr, 478.53 - Muhammad\u2019s father-in-law, who was not without his opponents: 481.56 - Many people wanted Ali, Muhammad\u2019s son-in-law, to lead the community. And although he did 485.38 - become the fourth caliph, that initial disagreement \u2014 to radically oversimplify because we only have 490.56 - ten minutes \u2014 began the divide between the two of the major sects of Islam: Suuni and Shi\u2019a. 495.85 - And even today, Sunnis Muslims believe Abu Bakr was rightly elected the first caliph 499.789 - and Shi\u2019a Muslims believe it should\u2019ve been Ali. 502.4 - To Sunnis, the first four caliphs\u2014Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali\u2014 are known as the 506.88 - Rightly Guided Caliphs, and many of the conservative movements in the Islamic world today are all 512.149 - about trying to restore the Islamic world to those glory days, which\u2014like most glory 518.3 - days\u2014were not unambiguously glorious. 520.409 - Abu Bakr stabilized the community after Muhammad\u2019s death, and began the process of recording 524.58 - the Quran in writing, 525.91 - And started the military campaigns against the Byzantine and Sassanian Empires that within 530.14 - 116 years would allow the Islamic Empire to go from this to this. 535.75 - His successor Umar was both an uncommonly good general and a brilliant administrator 539.86 - but like so many other great men, he proved terrible at avoiding assassination. 545.0 - Which led to the caliphate of Uthman, who standardized the Quran and continued both 548.49 - his predecessor\u2019s tradition of conquest and his predecessor\u2019s tradition of getting assassinated. 553.38 - Then Ali finally got his turn at caliph, but his ascension was very controversial, and 557.399 - it ultimately led to a civil war. 559.26 - Which eventually led to the emergence of Uthman\u2019s tribe, the Umayyads, as the dynasty ruling 563.22 - over an ever-expanding Islamic Empire for more than a hundred years. 566.7 - It\u2019s common to hear that in these early years Islam quote spread by the sword, and 570.4 - that\u2019s partly true, unless you are \u2014 wait for it \u2014 573.36 - the Mongols. 576.62 - Actually, as usual, the truth is more complicated:Many people, including the Mongols but also including 581.49 - lots of people in Central and East Asia, embraced Islam without any military campaigns. 586.73 - And in fact, the Quran says that religion must not be an act of compulsion, but this 590.26 - much is true: The early Islamic empire was really good at winning wars. 594.8 - And situated as they were between two very wealthy empires\u2014the Byzantines and the Sassanians\u2014there 599.81 - was plenty to fight for. 601.1 - First to fall was the Sassanians, the last non-Muslim successor to the Persian Empire. 605.51 - They were relatively easy pickings because they\u2019d been fighting the Byzantines for 609.029 - like 300 years and were super tired. Also they\u2019d been recently struck by plague. 614.54 - Plague, man, I\u2019m telling you; It\u2019s like the red tortoise shell of history. 619.529 - But in those early days they did pry away some valuable territory like Egypt and the 623.13 - holy land and eventually they got into Spain. 625.97 - Where various Muslim dynasties would entrench themselves until being expelled in 1492. 630.38 - But as a good as they were at making war, it\u2019s still tempting to chalk up the Arabs\u2019 634.04 - success to, you know, the will of God. 636.49 - And certainly a lot of the people they conquered felt that way. Wars in this part of the world 640.7 - didn\u2019t just pit people against each other, they also pitted their gods against each other. 645.709 - So while the Islamic Empire didn\u2019t require its subjects to convert to Islam, their stunning 649.779 - successes certainly convinced a lot of people that this monotheism thing was legit. 654.66 - Once again, John Green proving super hip to the slang of today\u2019s young\u2019ns. 659.75 - Also, you paid lower taxes if you converted, and just as taxes on cigarettes lead to people 664.51 - not wanting to smoke, taxes on worshiping your idols lead to people not wanting to worship them anymore. 670.13 - So in a period of time that was, historically speaking, both remarkably recent and remarkably 674.39 - short, a small group of people from an area of the world with no natural resources managed 679.32 - to create one of the great empires of the world and also one of its great religions. 683.78 - And that very fact may be why people of Western European descent remain 686.96 - largely ignorant about this period. 689.08 - Not only were the Muslims great conquerors, they spawned an explosion of trade and learning 692.93 - that lasted hundreds of years. 694.64 - They saved many of the classical texts that form the basis of the \u201cWestern Canon\u201d 698.839 - while Europe was ignoring them and they paved the way for the Renaissance. 701.92 - While it\u2019s important to remember that much of the world between Spain and the Indus River 705.83 - wasn\u2019t Arabized, most of it was so thoroughly Islamized that these days we can\u2019t think 710.709 - of the world we now call the Middle East without thinking of it as Islamic. 714.839 - Perhaps the greatest testimony to Islam\u2019s power to organize peoples lives and their 718.339 - communities is that, in Egypt, 5 times a day millions of people turn away from the Pyramids and toward Mecca. 725.7 - Egypt, birthplace to one of the longest continuous cultures the world has ever known, is now 731.1 - the largest Arab country in the world. 733.14 - Next week we\u2019ll talk about the Dark Ages. Spoiler alert: they were darkest in the evening. 736.96 - Thanks for watching and we\u2019ll see you next time. 738.75 - Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller, our script supervisor is Danica Johnson. 742.63 - The show is written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and myself and our graphics 746.61 - team is Thought Bubble. 747.78 - Last week\u2019s Phrase of the Week was \u201cThey Might Be Giants\u201d.

Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble! 88.3 - Imagine you're sitting alone in your room, singing along to your favorite Broadway show at the top of your lungs. 92.34 - Not another person in sight. 93.86 - Society isn\u2019t anywhere to be found. 95.62 - Except that it is. 97.04 - Even if you ignore the house that you\u2019re in \u2013 and the parents, siblings, or roommates you're probably bothering while you\u2019re singing so horribly 102.5 - \u2013 there\u2019s still the song that you\u2019re singing, and the music that goes with it. 105.58 - Those things, along with literally every object in the room that you didn't make yourself, are all products of society. 110.74 - And you might be all alone when you\u2019re belting out Hamilton, but you weren't alone when a friend first introduced you to the musical, and its songs. 116.34 - And for that matter, your taste in music isn't purely yours either. 119.88 - What kind of music you like can be influenced by anything from what you were exposed to as a kid, to what your friends like now, 125.4 - to what neighborhood you grew up in, or what schools you went to. 128.16 - Society is tricky; it gets in places you might not expect. 130.98 - Thanks Thought Bubble! 132.14 - So when we say that sociology is the study of society and human behavior, that means that sociology is incredibly broad. 138.08 - In fact, it may be the broadest of what we call the social sciences. 141.39 - The social sciences include disciplines like economics and psychology, and while they all have different focuses and perspectives, 146.6 - they're all trying to understand the social world objectively, through controlled and repeated observation. 151.58 - So what makes sociology different from any of these other social sciences? 155.42 - Well, like the others, sociology is looking for patterns \u2013 recurring characteristics or events. 160.16 - But it looks for all kinds of patterns in all kinds of places. 163.52 - Sociology looks at all aspects of society, and at all scales, from two people talking, to differences between nations. 169.42 - It's this scope that really sets sociology apart, especially in what\u2019s known as the sociological perspective. 174.52 - And the sociological perspective means two things: 176.96 - 1, It means seeing the general in the particular, and 2, it means seeing the strange in the familiar. 182.78 - Seeing the general in the particular is a way of saying that sociology tries to understand social behavior by placing it in its wider social context. 189.32 - To go back to you belting out Broadway tunes in your room, the sociologist who overhears you from the sidewalk might notice not just your choice of what to sing, 196.2 - but how that individual choice may have been influenced by your class, neighborhood, race, gender, or age. 201.82 - To take another example, a sociologist might not care whether or not you, in particular, decide to get married, 206.58 - but she might be interested in learning more about a declining marriage rate in your society \u2013 210.12 - and, say, what's causing it and whether it\u2019s having any societal impacts. 213.22 - Or maybe she\u2019s more interested in the fact that, in the US, people tend to marry partners of the same class and race as them. 218.34 - In both of these cases \u2013 what people sing or whom they marry \u2013 221.02 - the sociologist is interested in a general pattern, a pattern composed of a massive number of particular individual choices. 227.08 - Each individual forms a part of the pattern, and in looking at their individual choices, a sociologist can see elements of the whole pattern, like seeing how a single stone fits into a mosaic. 235.98 - Seeing the strange in the familiar is the second part of the sociological perspective, and it\u2019s maybe more difficult to do. 241.2 - To see the strange in the familiar is to approach the everyday world as though you were seeing it for the first time, as if you were from another world. 247.02 - This is hard, but it's also incredibly important, and kinda cool. 250.16 - When we asked, at the very beginning, why you raise your hand to ask a question in your math class but not at your dinner table, that\u2019s a very small example of trying to see the strange in the familiar. 258.24 - And this is so hard to do because your own society tends to look normal to you. 262.38 - You take it for granted. 263.54 - As you're socialized into it, you're taught a common-sense understanding of society, and that's not a bad thing! 268.24 - After all, you need a common sense understanding of society in order to live in it, right? 272.1 - You need to know that you shake hands when you meet someone new, and that red means stop, and that you should try to show up on time to things. 278.0 - But if sociology is going to study society, it needs to be able to look at these things as strange and unfamiliar, in order to really understand how they work, and to uncover patterns of behavior in a culture. 287.58 - Common sense has to just get us through the world; but sociology has to know what's true. 292.5 - And this is important, because a society\u2019s common sense doesn\u2019t consist only of harmless conventions, like shaking hands. 297.8 - Just 200 years ago in the US, it was common sense that only white men were capable of participating in society. 303.3 - It was common sense that slavery was right, and that women shouldn't be allowed to vote. 307.24 - These things were common sense then in the same way that their opposites are taken for granted now. 311.4 - And the sociological perspective \u2013 seeing the general in the particular and strange in the familiar \u2013 315.66 - helps us to understand problems like this, because it helps us see some of the key concepts in the study of society. 320.9 - Among these concepts: social location, marginalization, and power and inequality. 325.22 - If you imagine a map of society, laying out all the different social groups and their relationships to each other, then your social location is your spot on that map. 332.56 - Your social location is a way of classifying yourself, by race, social class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc. 338.86 - Understanding social location is important because, just like the sociologist looks for the general in the particular, 343.66 - a person\u2019s life and choices will be influenced by their social location. 346.84 - This is true in a bunch of ways: Most obvious is that your social location can limit your choices. 351.4 - Some groups have legal rights and privileges that others don\u2019t. 354.04 - For instance, until a few years ago, gays and lesbians could not legally marry in the US, so their social location limited their choices. 359.94 - But social location also impacts what you learn, and what you\u2019re taught about society. 364.18 - Whether or not you you go to college, for instance, can be heavily influenced by whether the social class you grew up in tends to see college as a real or valuable possibility. 371.56 - And social location also affects what others have learned, and are taught, about you. 375.72 - Take, for instance, the consistent finding that resum\u00e9s with names that sound African-American tend to get called for interviews much less often than those with white-sounding names, 384.42 - even though the resum\u00e9s are otherwise identical. 387.14 - In all these ways, social location can contribute to the marginalization of a social group. 391.54 - If a social group is marginalized, it means that it occupies a position outside the centers of power. 395.9 - Marginalized groups are often racial, ethnic, sexual, or religious minorities, and marginalized groups tend to have a clearer view of how power operates. 403.12 - Heterosexual people, for example, often don\u2019t recognize what a social power it is to have their relationships socially sanctioned, 409.02 - and to be able to display affection in public, in ways that LGBT people often can\u2019t. 412.92 - If marginalization is a matter of being outside the centers of power, that draws our attention to another fact: 418.36 - the fact that there are many different kinds of power, and many different kinds of inequality. 422.72 - There are, of course, the obvious kinds, like economic power and income inequality, or political power and politically-enforced inequalities, like segregation or slavery. 430.52 - But then there are the less obvious kinds, like social or cultural power and inequality. 434.36 - For instance, people who speak with non-standard accents or dialects are often judged harshly for them and can be seen as less intelligent or less mature. 441.1 - Sociology can help us identify and understand all of these things, and maybe even try and fix them. 446.14 - And that\u2019s the point: Sociology is about understanding society, and society's where we all live, so we'd like it to work as well as possible. 453.98 - Good sociology can help us to create good public policy. 456.98 - And if we think back to Comte, his desire was to do just this, to understand and maybe fix his society's problems. 462.46 - The late 18th and 19th centuries were a time of massive economic, social, and political upheaval in Europe. 467.5 - This was when industrialization really took off, with factories sprouting up like weeds, connected by larger and larger rail networks. 473.02 - At the same time, the population of Europe exploded, growing faster than at any time in previous history. 477.78 - This was especially true in cities, where industrial production was centralized. 480.88 - And all of these massive economic and social changes came with political shocks, too: 484.78 - This period saw the advent of mass democracy, the fall of kings, and the rise of the nation-state. 489.06 - This, combined with the rise of science as a discipline, was the context in which  sociology arose. 493.84 - The first sociologists looked around at their quickly changing societies and were driven to try and scientifically understand them. 499.42 - We said earlier that society wasn't just big things like revolutions, industrialization, demographics. 504.08 - But it is also these things. 505.92 - It's both the big and the small, because they\u2019re related. 508.78 - Sociology is about understanding the whole thing, at every level, and how those levels interact. 513.74 - It's about understanding why you don\u2019t have to raise your hand at the dinner table, and why so-called common sense can lead to massive policy mistakes. 520.44 - Welcome to the science of sociology. 522.78 - Today we talked about what sociology is and what it does. 525.9 - We discussed what it means to be the study of society and why that's broader than you might think. 530.12 - We introduced the sociological perspective and discussed how sociology differentiates itself from the other social sciences. 535.86 - And finally we discussed what sociology can do, and how that concern with social problems was at the center of sociology's beginnings. 542.34 - Next time, we'll introduce different theories of society, the basic paradigms of sociology. 547.16 - Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C.

hi guys my name's Andy Crowley thank you 2.72 - for joining me for day one of this 10day 5.6 - guitar challenge where we're going to 7.08 - play guitar for 10 minutes a day for 10 10.04 - days this day one is my absolute 12.799 - beginner's first lesson so if you were 14.719 - taking a onetoone uh private lesson with 17.52 - me and you'd never even held a guitar 19.96 - before or you tried a few bits in the 21.88 - past but it was a long time ago and this 24.24 - is the guitar lesson that I would be 26.119 - showing you in this lesson I'm going to 28.16 - show you how to play the easiest two 30.16 - chords on guitar and then get you 32.04 - playing your first song by the end of 34.239 - this video in under 10 minutes so if 37.079 - you've never even played a song before 38.8 - this is the ideal place to start and 41.36 - let's get you straight in for a closeup 43.2 - and learn how to play these two easy 45.48 - chords so the first chord we're going to 47.719 - be learning is the E major chord also 51.0 - known as an E chord and this is where we 53.399 - need to place our fingers to be able to 54.96 - play 56.96 - it now if your guitar isn't in tune it 60.039 - doesn't really matter where you put your 61.44 - fingers on the guitar it's not going to 63.16 - sound right there is a video of mine in 64.96 - the description below where you'll find 66.72 - a video showing you exactly how to tune 68.759 - your guitar with and without a guitar 71.119 - tuner so check out that video first if 73.68 - you suspect that something isn't 75.52 - sounding right here but I'm going to 77.6 - talk you through a couple of other bits 78.96 - of the guitar before we get fully 80.68 - started so these metal strips going down 83.799 - the guitar here are your Frets and going 86.32 - across are the strings we number the 89.04 - strings thinnest to thickest so one two 92.84 - three four five six and each fret it's 97.04 - the area between the metal strips that 99.32 - we'd call fret one fret two and fret 103.2 - three anytime we place a finger on a 106.24 - fret we really want it to be to this 108.759 - side of the Fret so the side nearest to 111.0 - you up against the metal strip but not 114.119 - on it so if I wanted to place my finger 116.399 - on First Finger first fret it would be 119.479 - placed here rather than in the middle 122.759 - and we also want to be right on the tip 124.92 - of your finger like this for this first 128.52 - chord the E major chord we need that 131.36 - first finger to be on the third string 134.36 - at that first fret so that's just here 137.92 - right on the tip of our finger and we 140.16 - are pressing between our thumb and First 142.56 - Finger my thumb is directly behind where 145.16 - my first finger is on the guitar just 148.28 - here the middle finger needs to be at 151.68 - the second fret of the fifth string so 155.0 - string five 1 2 3 4 5 and the third 159.599 - finger otherwise known as the ring 161.64 - finger goes here directly underneath at 166.04 - the same fret on the string below so 169.239 - just one recap these fingers are placed 171.76 - finger number one or the index 175.0 - finger middle 177.56 - finger and the third finger finger here 181.319 - the little finger it's best to keep it 183.48 - as close to the third finger as possible 186.0 - rather than shooting off and doing its 188.04 - own thing this is where we want to place 190.599 - it here for this particular chord we do 193.04 - want to strum all six strings and make 195.599 - sure that they're all heard so let's do 197.959 - that now and strum our E major 200.57 - [Music] 202.68 - chord now that sounds like it should 205.319 - sound and hopefully yours sounds the 207.08 - same if not your guitar may be out of 209.0 - tune so check out that tuning video 211.439 - however we also want to make sure that 213.239 - all six strings are ringing out by which 215.68 - we want to pick the thickest to the 218.0 - thinnest string so string six to 220.4 - [Music] 224.599 - one and if they all sound like that then 227.04 - we're doing it correctly possibly one of 230.0 - the 231.079 - strings sounds a little bit like this we 233.56 - got a little bit 235.04 - of either buzzing or it's not ringing 238.519 - out at all like this there are two 240.64 - common reasons that that can be the case 242.92 - the first thing is you need to be at 245.079 - this side of the Fret as I said at the 247.159 - start of the video if they're in the 248.56 - middle of the Fret that may not ring out 251.48 - they all want to be at this side of the 254.159 - Fret not at the far side and then each 257.32 - finger also needs to be right on the tip 260.079 - not flat now this is common because 262.84 - whenever we hold things say if I was 264.68 - just holding this guitar neck to pick it 266.52 - up we'd grip it like this but this is 269.28 - not how we press down notes on a 271.12 - stringed instrument we need to be right 272.96 - on the tips of our fingers and make sure 275.199 - that this joint in our fingers is bent 278.32 - and kind of curled over so that each tip 281.12 - of the finger is at 90\u00b0 to the Fret and 284.16 - when those two things are the case when 285.96 - we're at this side of the Fret and on 288.039 - the tips of our 291.24 - fingers it's just a case of getting that 293.96 - right amount of pressure down but with 296.0 - the right finger placement it may be a 298.12 - little bit less than than you think now 300.28 - even I at this point have some lines on 302.479 - the end of my fingers this is normal we 304.919 - do have to press down you know a decent 307.52 - amount to get the note ringing out but 309.28 - try not to press down any more than you 311.56 - need to try and find that sweet spot the 314.4 - second chord we're going to cover in 315.8 - this video is the air major chord and 318.68 - with this chord we can play any one of 320.8 - 10 songs as I say there will be a song 322.68 - at the end of this particular video but 324.96 - there are a number of songs 10 songs 327.08 - that are played only using these two 328.88 - chords on my website and the link to 330.84 - that is also in the description so to 333.199 - play the a major chord it's best to 334.88 - start off on the E major chord that we 337.199 - already known now we need to keep this 340.12 - first finger down but lift the other two 342.56 - away and this is really important this 344.68 - is going to be our anchor finger because 346.52 - when we're learning chords the hard 348.28 - thing isn't necessarily playing one 349.88 - chord it's the change between so what 352.68 - we're going to do is keep this first 353.919 - finger down but slide it over to the 356.919 - second fret and this time we want to be 359.0 - around in the middle of the Fret because 362.12 - we're going to place the middle finger 364.039 - above it at that same second fret and 367.199 - the third finger directly below it and 370.12 - this is the a major chord you may have 373.039 - seen this chord played like this however 375.759 - if this is the first time you've ever 377.24 - picked up a Guitar before it's going to 379.319 - be incredibly difficult to change 381.12 - between any chords and these included so 383.759 - we're making this as easy as possible by 385.599 - keeping contact with the fretboard at 387.919 - all times and using that first finger as 390.4 - an anchor point so this is the a major 393.24 - chord that we're going for Let's uh 396.479 - place this first finger at the third 398.88 - string second fret one 2 middle finger 403.599 - goes directly above it and third finger 406.479 - below it and it's best to keep that 408.479 - first finger around in the middle of the 410.28 - Fret this time and this time only really 413.72 - so that we can fit the other two 416.8 - in and with this particular chord we 419.639 - want to strum from string 422.0 - five and this is what the a major chord 424.96 - should sound like to check that all 427.16 - those strings are ringing out we want to 428.68 - pick again from the thickest to the 430.24 - thinnest but we're going to start from 432.28 - string 435.039 - five there is more opportunity for 437.24 - Strings not ringing out on this one so 439.24 - again try and get them as far to towards 441.599 - you as possible and keep right on the 444.319 - tips that is the best way to get them 447.08 - ringing out but you may have to press on 449.28 - just just a little bit harder on this 451.24 - chord to get those strings ringing out 453.12 - one more time 455.0 - strum pick each 458.68 - string and 460.74 - [Music] 463.44 - strum so to change between those chords 466.159 - we need to keep that first finger down 468.199 - at all times and change between them so 470.759 - if we go back to the E major chord now 473.8 - and just give it one single strum of all 475.72 - six strings we keep the first finger 477.919 - down slide to the second fret middle 480.599 - finger above third finger below and 484.599 - strum and then to change back the first 487.28 - finger stays down slide it back to that 490.0 - first fret middle finger above third 492.639 - finger 494.199 - below and 496.84 - strum again so we're on that first chord 499.24 - that we looked at now the E chord so we 501.4 - keep the first finger down we slide it 503.319 - to the second fret for the second chord 506.0 - that we looked at middle finger above 508.639 - third finger below 510.72 - and strum try and strum from the fifth 514.2 - string so missing out the thickest 516.12 - string but if you do accidentally catch 518.479 - that thickest string it's okay for now 520.76 - we're just learning first finger stays 522.719 - down we move back to the first fret for 525.08 - our first chord which is the E 528.08 - major and strum and that's our E 531.959 - major now you may wish to pause the 534.16 - video here so that you can have a little 536.0 - bit longer practice between those two 538.12 - chords changing between the the E and 540.079 - the a chord remember to keep your first 542.399 - finger down at all 544.24 - times and the first chord we looked at 546.68 - has your first finger on the first fret 548.959 - and then chord number two the air 551.44 - chord first finger second fret middle 554.04 - finger above third finger below and 557.04 - strum and you're wanting your 559.8 - fingers to take around a second to go to 563.64 - each chord to move on to the second part 567.12 - which is basically going straight for 569.16 - our our first song which is a song 571.399 - called for what it's worth by Buffalo 573.64 - Springfield this song has just these two 575.959 - chords and we have to play each chord 578.24 - for a bar of each to do this we need to 581.279 - understand about bars and beats the beat 584.04 - is whatever you would nod your head to 586.04 - when your favorite song comes on so when 588.24 - you're kind of grooving onto a song and 590.72 - tapping your foot and enjoying it you're 592.76 - tapping your feet or nodding your head 594.839 - to the beat this is an even pulse 597.519 - throughout the song and It generally 599.88 - goes to a count of four so an even count 603.6 - of 1 2 3 4 and that is repeated 608.0 - throughout an entire song evenly it's 610.92 - that count of four that we call a bar so 614.44 - the simplest struming pattern we can do 616.079 - for any song is just strumming on the 618.44 - beat and we're going to strum each chord 620.519 - in this particular song four times so we 623.519 - strum the E chord four times 1 2 3 4 629.36 - four and keep that first finger down 631.44 - when we're going to change to the second 633.36 - chord which is the a chord and then 635.12 - strum this four times one 2 3 640.48 - 4 and then we need to change back to the 643.639 - E chord and do this in a loop for around 647.16 - a minute and if you've never heard that 649.519 - particular song that we're going for the 651.6 - link is in the description to a YouTube 653.279 - video of the song so you can have a 654.6 - quick listen to it to hear what we're 656.2 - going for and you should pretty 657.92 - distinctly hear this uh rhythm guitar 661.36 - part throughout the entire 663.33 - [Music] 663.94 - [Applause] 667.52 - [Music] 678.24 - song now keeping the strumming hand 680.839 - going while changing chord is 683.32 - undoubtedly the trickiest part of 685.56 - learning songs on guitar however this 688.6 - anchor thing keeping the first finger 691.04 - down makes it a much easier task and 694.24 - helps us going forward to learn the 696.24 - other chords that we're going to be 697.44 - learning in the coming days so drilling 700.56 - this change is so important rather than 703.519 - learning more chord so many beginners 705.839 - get a book full of 10 chords or 100 708.32 - chords and try and learn them but it's 710.24 - mastering the change between them that's 712.12 - going to get you the end goal of being 714.36 - able to play real songs as soon as 716.72 - possible and hopefully this will be one 718.639 - that you can play just in a few minutes 720.56 - now by following me so let's start with 722.8 - the E major chord the first chord we 724.88 - covered in this video and we're going to 727.2 - strum this four times and soon as we've 730.32 - done that we want as soon as we strum 732.16 - that fourth strum we want to change 734.519 - immediately to the air cord as swiftly 738.0 - as possible now if this takes a few 740.04 - attempts and that is totally fine 742.6 - because this is the end goal of this 745.04 - first video of this day one of this 747.399 - 10day guitar course so so if it's a 750.24 - little struggle at first that's 752.36 - understandable cuz it might be the first 753.8 - thing that you've ever done go easy on 756.199 - yourself allow this trickiest part of 758.76 - this the cord changes to bed in and for 761.399 - you to get used to them before you put 763.36 - too much pressure on 765.199 - yourself so let's play along together 767.88 - really slowly now and let's have a go 770.16 - playing our first song for what it's 772.04 - worth by Buffalo 774.0 - Springfield so we get ready on our eord 777.279 - we press down and we begin struming in 2 781.16 - 3 4 1 2 3 4 then change to the a chord 789.04 - and begin strumming again 1 2 3 back to 794.04 - the E changing back and 1 2 3 4 first 800.959 - finger stays down we change to the A 1 2 805.44 - 3 4 and pause there so now Now's the 809.56 - Time to take stock with how you're doing 812.04 - if you need to pause the video just 813.48 - briefly one time again to just do some 815.6 - individual changes which will drill that 818.44 - change a little more often to help you 820.48 - get used to it more maybe take a quick 822.839 - break to rest your fingers a little bit 824.6 - cuz you might have big lines and they 826.04 - might be quite sore that's 827.959 - understandable and totally normal in the 830.0 - beginning and when you feel up to it 831.92 - play this video from this point one more 834.04 - time and this time we're going to try 836.16 - and get those spaces between the chord 838.12 - changes as as quick as possible and the 841.44 - goal is just to keep our right hand 843.16 - strumming evenly no matter what chord 845.72 - we're playing or whether there's a 847.68 - change or not we're just going to try 849.6 - and keep this chord and strumming okay 852.32 - so from the E chord Play Along With Me 855.279 - One Last Time in 1 2 3 4 e 2 3 then 2 a 865.32 - a 2 3 4 e 2 3 4 and a 2 3 4 e 2 3 4 a 2 883.6 - 3 one last time from the e e 2 3 4 and a 890.6 - 2 3 finish on 893.08 - [Music] 897.759 - E and that's that's how to play our 900.0 - first song and that is the end of day 902.68 - one of this 10day guitar challenge so 905.72 - thank you very much for making it this 907.44 - far your homework now is to practice 910.639 - these two chords the E major and the a 912.959 - major the changes between them and then 915.32 - try and play them for four strums of the 917.24 - E chord and the four strums for the a 919.759 - chord and we want to keep that chord 921.759 - sequence going for around a minute and 924.0 - in total that should be around 10 925.92 - minutes worth of practice so if you do 928.319 - that straight away after watching this 930.24 - video you'll be in the perfect position 932.44 - to join me for day two tomorrow where 934.68 - we'll learn a new guitar chord and a new 937.36 - song and this time the song will have a 939.36 - very easy lead guitar part which is a 941.88 - bit more of a Melody so we won't just be 944.12 - focusing on chords in this course we'll 946.6 - also focus on some single string playing 949.0 - as well it's going to be really cool 950.839 - it's going to sound just like the song 952.399 - and be really really recognizable 954.279 - something great to show your friends and 956.24 - I hope you will join me there thank you 958.199 - very much for watch watching guys please 960.279 - subscribe if you enjoy this course and 962.56 - I'm sure I'll see you again in one of my 964.279 - videos take care of yourselves and bye 966.16 - for now"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

No, instead, we're going to look at why we have elections 29.18 - in the first place, and the institutions and procedures that structure the way elections work in America. 33.56 - We might even compare them to elections in other places, but I can't make any promises. 37.02 - [Theme Music] 45.94 - Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how elections work in the U.S., it might be a 49.239 - good time to ask a question that rarely gets asked, \"Why do we have elections in the first place?\" 53.14 - A simple answer is, \"Complexity.\" America's too big and complex to hold public referendums 57.86 - on individual issues, although some states, like California, try to do it. So, instead, we choose 62.0 - representatives. In other words, we vote for people, not policies. Elections are as good a system holding 66.34 - these representatives accountable as any. Well,  at least they're better than violence or public shaming. 70.42 - Political scientists and economists have a more complicated way of describing this in 73.68 - terms of \"adverse selection.\" Because why would we want a simple answer when we have 77.08 - political scientists and economists around? Well, they gotta do somethin'. Adverse selection 80.939 - is a problem that can arise when we make a choice but do not necessarily have all the 84.28 - information we need to make that choice. Kind of like when you buy a used car. 87.44 - Elections help to solve this problem because they are ideally competitive. The competition 91.18 - creates incentives for candidates to provide information about themselves and to make most 94.9 - of that information accurate since their opponent will call them out for any statements that 98.46 - are less than truthful. At least, that's what we hope will happen. 101.46 - Elections also supposedly make candidates more accountable since they provide voters 105.159 - a chance to get rid of bad actors. Of course, this only works when elections are 108.86 - competitive, and, as we'll see in a later episode, many elections in the U.S. really aren't. 112.66 - You might think that since elections are so important to our politics that they would 115.43 - be featured prominently in the Constitution, but yeah, no. The Constitution does set up 119.649 - a few basic guidelines that structure American elections, but most of the important rules 123.35 - that define the way elections are carried out come out of state laws, legal decisions, 127.09 - and local administrative practices. So what does the Constitution say about elections? 130.45 - Not a lot, as it turns out, except when it comes to choosing the president. 134.07 - President just gets everything... President's so important. 137.09 - The Constitution does lay out the qualifications for running for federal office--which we already 140.8 - when over in our episodes on Congress and the President -- and it describes the number 144.12 - of Representatives and Senators. But mostly the Constitution leaves elections up to the 147.79 - states. Article 1, Section 4 says, \"The times, places and manner of holding elections for 152.42 - Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress 157.14 - may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators. \" 162.16 - And the Constitution was later changed to allow for direct election of Senators with 165.26 - the Seventeenth Amendment, so that last clause doesn't matter so much anymore. The Constitution 169.099 - does say more about the way the President is chosen indirectly through the Electoral 172.32 - College, but the framers messed that up so badly that they had to amend the Constitution 175.849 - after the election of 1800. The Twelfth Amendment, which basically means that the President and 179.689 - Vice-President come from the same political party -- although it doesn't actually say that -- fixed 183.54 - the electoral process. So now it's flawless. But it's still indirect and the qualifications 187.95 - for the electors who choose the president are still left up to the states. 190.79 - Some Constitutional amendments also help to structure American elections. The Twenty-Fourth 194.48 - Amendment outlawed poll taxes, which made it easier for poor people to vote, and the 198.06 - Twenty-Sixth Amendment lowered the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. In general, 201.739 - when Congress addresses voting issues, it's to try to expand the pool of voters. 205.18 - Although the Constitution doesn't specify when elections happen, it does give Congress 208.73 - the power to do so, and it requires that the day on which the electors choose the president 212.31 - has to be one single day. This is in Article Two: \"The Congress may determine the time 216.48 - of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall 220.18 - be the same throughout the United States.\" 222.06 - Congressional laws also help structure elections by making them more fair. The Voting Rights 225.93 - Act of 1965 set up a number of systems to increase voter participation by minority groups, 230.69 - especially African Americans. And Congress also set up the Federal Election Commission, 234.69 - which has some say over elections. I'll tell you who should never be allowed to vote: eagles! 241.36 - You're gerrymandered out of here. 243.11 - But generally, following the Constitution, most aspects of elections are under the control 246.879 - of the states. State laws define how candidates are nominated and get on the ballot, and they 250.819 - can influence the operation of political parties. State laws also determine registration requirements 254.939 - for voting and set up the location and hours of polling places, which vary a lot from state to state. 259.42 - Probably most important for federal elections, state decide the boundaries of Congressional 263.16 - election districts, although not the number of representatives each state has, which is 266.9 - determined by the state's population. We'll talk more about election districts in a future episode. 271.22 - That's what gerrymandering has to do with. Remember when I gerrymandered the eagle? 274.3 - Yeah, that's a preview for what's coming. 276.11 - Although this is not always true in every case, as a general rule of thumb, the federal 279.46 - government is more likely to pass laws that expand voting, and states are the government that restrict 283.74 - voting, especially through registration requirements and taking the vote away from people convicted of felonies. 288.5 - One important aspect of American elections that has been set up by state laws 291.81 - is the way that winners have been decided. We like to say that in America, majority rules. 296.06 - But for the most part, this isn't really true, at least as far as elections are concerned. 299.389 - In most states, and in most elections, we follow the Plurality Rule, and this has important 303.02 - consequences for American politics. Let's go the Thought Bubble. 305.8 - Under the Plurality Rule, the candidate with the most votes wins. The number does not have 309.38 - to be a majority, and the more candidates in the race, the less likely anyone will get the majority. 313.86 - Suppose your election has four candidates: A, B, C, and D. Candidate A gets 20% of the 318.919 - vote, Candidate B gets 30%, candidate C gets 25%, and Candidate D also gets 25%. That should 324.74 - add up to 100%. It does? Thank goodness! Okay, so no one has a majority here, so who wins? 329.26 - Candidate B, of course, because she has the most votes, 30%. Now you'll notice something 332.96 - about this election that may be a bit of a paradox: the significant majority of voters 336.43 - in this election, 70% in fact, have chosen Not B. Yet, B is that one that wins. This 340.729 - is why we need to be very careful when we say that majority rules, because in many cases, it doesn't. 345.0 - But in some cases, it does. Some states do have a majority rule in their elections. In 348.96 - these states, if no candidate gets more than 50% plus 1 of the vote, then the top two vote-getters 353.6 - go on to what's called a run-off election. In this second election, you almost always get a majority. 358.1 - In many cases, we also say that American elections are \"Winner take all.\" This is the case in 362.039 - forty-eight out of fifty states when it comes to electoral votes. What this means is that 365.63 - the winner of the election gets 100% of the state's electoral votes, even though it's 369.8 - likely they wouldn't have carried 100% of the votes. It is possible for a state to decide 373.56 - to award its electoral delegates proportionately, based on the percentage of votes that a candidate receives, 378.08 - or even by electoral district, although the latter rule causes some problems, as we'll see in another episode. 382.71 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, the Plurality Rule can result in the majority of people 386.24 - being represented by someone they voted against. This seems like a bad system, so why do we 390.479 - have it? The main reason is efficiency. Under plurality rule, you get a definite winner 394.55 - that you might not have under a majority rule. It also allows for a greater variety of candidates 398.479 - to win, at least potentially. And it has one key result for America's political system: 402.699 - it pretty much ensures that we will only have two viable political parties. 405.789 - The concept that plurality rules create two-party systems is explained by something called Duverger's Law. 410.72 - Here's how it works. Imagine political parties on a continuum from extreme right to extreme left. 415.06 - Most voters will not fall into either extreme, so the masses of party followers will coalesce 419.36 - around the center-right and center-left. In these conditions, there's no incentive to form a third party 423.82 - because it's likely to take votes away from the centrist party, and thus throw the election to the other party. 428.04 - Let's say that you're on the right of the political spectrum. You like the ideas of 431.02 - the center right party, but you think they're a little bit weak, and you'd like to see someone 434.05 - speak up more for your right-most ideas. You could vote for the candidate whose ideology 438.02 - and policies are more to your liking, but they're not likely to win. Remember, most 441.639 - people prefer center-right ideas over extreme-right ideas. That's why they're extreme. So, the 445.99 - candidate you would most like to support isn't going to win, but what's worse for you is 448.86 - that by voting for them, you take away votes from the candidate you partially agree with. 452.26 - Since people know that third-parties almost never win, we're left with only two parties in the U.S. 455.88 - Now, Duverger's Law is important for political scientists, and it explains broadly why we 459.61 - have two parties, but a look at American politics in the second decade of the twentieth century 463.419 - suggests that parties are more extreme than the model would lead us to believe. The polarization 467.289 - of parties is the subject of another episode on the composition of parties and how they 470.87 - reflect political ideologies. But for now, it's still useful to understand how elections 474.729 - themselves work to shape the party system we have in the U.S. This is what we sometimes 478.49 - call a structural or institutional view of politics, and it's the kind of thing political 482.139 - scientists really, really like. We'll look closely at the actual political parties and 486.139 - who votes for which one in other episodes. But I hope we've provided a little bit of 489.66 - insight into how elections work in the U.S. 491.5 - Thanks for watching.

(Laughter) 59.558 - So there is so much to learn and so much craziness all at once. 64.409 - And to add to the craziness,  Kelsey and I both work from home, 68.533 - we're entrepreneurs, we run our own businesses. 71.223 - So, Kelsey develops courses online for yoga teachers. 76.992 - I'm an author. 78.333 - And so, I'm working from home, Kelsey's working from home. 80.782 - We have an infant and we're trying to make sure 83.901 - that everything gets done that needs done. 86.725 - And life is really, really busy. 92.357 - And a couple of weeks into this amazing experience, 96.718 - when the sleep deprivation really kicked in, 100.247 - like around week eight, 102.299 - I had this thought, and it was the same thought 105.732 - that parents across the ages, internationally, 109.773 - everybody has had this thought, which is: 112.467 - I am never going to have free time ever again. 118.054 - (Laughter) 119.183 - Somebody said it's true. 122.403 - It's not exactly true, 125.214 - but it feels really, really true in that moment. 129.866 - And this was really disconcerning to me, 132.075 - because one of the things that I enjoy 135.484 - more than anything else is learning new things. 139.428 - Getting curious about something and diving in 142.261 - and fiddling around and  learning through trial and error. 145.164 - And eventually becoming pretty good at something. 148.44 - And without this free time, 152.336 - I didn't know how I was ever  going to do that ever again. 156.405 - And so, I'm a big geek, 158.877 - I want to keep learning things, I want to keep growing. 162.07 - And so what I've decided to do was, 165.087 - go to the library, and go to the bookstore, 167.784 - and look at what research says about 169.922 - how we learn and how we learn quickly. 173.523 - And I read a bunch of books, I read a bunch of websites. 176.834 - And tried to answer this question, 179.091 - how long does it take to acquire a new skill? 183.04 - You know what I found? 185.117 - 10,000 hours! 189.438 - Anybody ever heard this? 191.2 - It takes 10,000 hours. If you want to learn something new, 194.134 - if you want to be good at it, 195.584 - it's going to take 10,000 hours to get there. 197.934 - And I read this in book after book, in website after website. 201.455 - And my mental experience of reading all of this stuff was like: 208.421 - No!! 210.799 - I don't have time! I don't have 10,000 hours. 214.539 - I am never going to be able to learn anything new. 219.088 - Ever again. (Laughter) 222.421 - But that's not true. 223.479 - So, 10,000 hours, just to give you a rough order of magnitude, 226.559 - 10,000 hours is a full-time job for five years. 232.422 - That's a long time. 234.008 - And we've all had the experience of learning something new, 236.364 - and it didn't take us anywhere close to that amount of time, right? 240.439 - So, what's up? There's something kinda funky going on here. 243.505 - What the research says and what we expect, and have experiences, 247.078 - they don't match up. 249.416 - And what I found, here's the wrinkle: 252.993 - The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies of expert-level performance. 259.722 - There's a professor at Florida State University, 262.228 - his name is K. Anders Ericsson. 264.226 - He is the originator of the 10,00 hour rule. 266.725 - And where that came from is, he studied professional athletes, 271.261 - world class musicians, chess grand masters. 275.763 - All of this ultra competitive folks in ultra-high performing fields. 280.775 - And he tried to figure out how long does it take 283.751 - to get to the top of those kinds of fields. 286.811 - And what he found is, the more deliberate practice, 289.668 - the more time that those individuals spend 292.194 - practicing the elements of whatever it is that they do, 295.304 - the more time you spend, the better you get. 297.246 - And the folks at the tippy top of their fields 300.165 - put in around 10,000 hours of practice. 305.101 - Now, we were talking about the game of telephone a little bit earlier. 309.442 - Here's what happened: 311.236 - an author by the name of Malcolm Gladwell 313.458 - wrote a book in 2007 called \"Outliers: The Story of Success\", 317.901 - and the central piece of that book was the 10,000 hour rule. 321.592 - Practice a lot, practice well, and you will do extremely well, 325.642 - you will reach the top of your field. 327.367 - So, the message, 329.472 - what Dr. Ericsson was actually saying is, 332.455 - it takes 10,000 hours to get at the top of an ultra competitive field 337.425 - in a very narrow subject, that's what that means. 341.857 - But here's what happened: ever since Outliers came out, 345.294 - immediately came out, reached the top of best seller lists, 347.449 - stayed there for three solid months. 350.056 - All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rule was everywhere. 354.171 - And a society-wide game of telephone started to be played. 360.022 - So this message, it takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field, 364.955 - became, it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something, 369.927 - which became, 371.366 - it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something, 375.667 - which became, 377.192 - it takes 10,000 hours to learn something. 381.455 - But that last statement, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something, 385.337 - is not true. It's not true. 388.6 - So, what the research actually says -- 393.346 - I spent a lot of time here at the CSU library 396.217 - in the cognitive psychology stacks 'cause I'm a geek. 399.523 - And when you actually look at the studies of skill acquisition, 404.216 - you see over and over a graph like this. 408.039 - Now, researchers, whether they're studying a motor skill, 411.694 - something you do physically or a mental skill, 414.328 - they like to study things that they can time. 417.174 - 'Cause you can quantify that, right? 419.185 - So, they'll give research participants a little task, 422.452 - something that requires physical arrangement, 424.156 - or something that requires learning a little mental trick, 428.925 - and they'll time how long a participant takes to complete the skill. 433.357 - And here's what this graph says, when you start -- 436.095 - so when researchers gave participants a task, it took them a really long time, 440.398 - 'cause it was new and they were horrible. 443.053 - With a little bit of practice, they get better and better and better. 446.651 - And that early part of practice is really, really efficient. 450.632 - People get good at things with just a little bit of practice. 456.021 - Now, what's interesting to note is that, 459.663 - for skills that we want to learn for ourselves, 462.869 - we don't care so much about time, right? 465.736 - We just care about how good we are, whatever good happens to mean. 469.283 - So if we relabel performance time to how good you are, 474.943 - the graph flips, and you get his famous and widely known, 479.346 - this is the learning curve. 481.274 - And the story of the learning curve is when you start, 483.852 - you're grossly incompetent and you know it, right? 486.567 - (Laughter) 488.635 - With a little bit of practice, you get really good, really quick. 491.997 - So that early level of improvement is really fast. 495.715 - And then at a certain point you reach a plateau, 498.63 - and the subsequent games become much harder to get, 501.96 - they take more time to get. 504.659 - Now, my question is, I want that, right? 508.62 - How long does it take from starting something 511.605 - and being grossly incompetent and knowing it 515.265 - to being reasonably good? 517.575 - In hopefully, as short a period of time as possible. 522.329 - So, how long does that take? 524.539 - Here's what my research says: 20 hours. 529.518 - That's it. You can go from knowing nothing 533.163 - about any skill that you can think of. 535.739 - Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to draw? 539.175 - Want to learn how to juggle flaming chainsaws? 542.294 - (Laughter) 543.32 - If you put 20 hours of focused deliberate practice into that thing, 548.532 - you will be astounded. 550.964 - Astounded at how good you are. 554.135 - 20 hours is doable, 555.645 - that's about 45 minutes a day for about a month. 559.956 - Even skipping a couple days, here and there. 562.066 - 20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate. 565.221 - Now, there's a method to doing this. 568.1 - Because it's not like you can just start fiddling around for about 20 hours 571.097 - and expect these massive improvements. 573.044 - There's a way to practice intelligently. 575.713 - There's a way to practice efficiently, 577.997 - that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours 581.051 - in the most effective way that you possibly can. 583.592 - And here's the method, it applies to anything: 587.518 - The first is to deconstruct the skill. 591.363 - Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done, 596.262 - and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces. 602.072 - Most of the things that we think of as skills 606.042 - are actually big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things. 610.639 - The more you can break apart the skill, 614.211 - the more you're able to decide, 616.583 - what are the parts of this skill that would actually help me 618.974 - get to what I want? 621.365 - And then you can practice those first. 623.758 - And if you practice the most important things first, 625.96 - you'll be able to improve your performance 628.731 - in the least amount of time possible. 631.502 - The second is, learn enough to self correct. 634.273 - So, get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn. 638.467 - Could be book, could be DVDs, could be courses, could be anything. 643.719 - But don't use those as a way to procrastinate on practice. 648.95 - I know I do this, right? 650.585 - Get like 20 books about the topic, like, 652.661 - \"I'm going to start learning how to program a computer 655.138 - when I complete these 20 books\". 657.615 - No. That's procrastination. 660.094 - What you want to do is learn just enough 664.141 - that you can actually practice 665.85 - and self correct or self edit as you practice. 670.914 - So the learning becomes a way of getting better 673.819 - at noticing when you're making a mistake 676.724 - and then doing something a little different. 679.63 - The third is to remove barriers to practice. 684.106 - Distractions, television, internet. 686.55 - All of these things that get in the way 689.929 - of you actually sitting down and doing the work. 693.308 - And the more you're able to use just a little bit of willpower 696.689 - to remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing, 699.887 - the more likely you are to actually sit down and practice, right? 706.27 - And the fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. 711.473 - Now, most skills have what I call a frustration barrier. 714.77 - You know, the grossly-incompetent- and-knowing-it part? 718.078 - That's really, really frustrating. We don't like to feel stupid. 722.374 - And feeling stupid is a barrier to us  actually sitting down and doing the work. 727.314 - So, by pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do 731.762 - for at least 20 hours, 734.378 - you will be able to overcome that initial frustration barrier 738.918 - and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards. 743.029 - That's it! It's not rocket science. 745.368 - Four very simple steps that you can use to learn anything. 751.466 - Now, this is easy to talk about in theory, 755.302 - but it's more fun to talk about in practice. 757.703 - So one of the things that I've wanted to learn how to do for a long time 761.964 - is play the ukulele. 764.163 - Has anybody seen Jake Shimabukuro's TEDTalk 767.787 - where he plays the ukulele and makes it sound like -- 770.901 - he's like a ukulele god. 772.26 - It's amazing. 774.026 - I saw it, I was like, \"That is so cool!\" 777.206 - It's such a neat instrument. I would really like to learn how to play. 781.373 - And so I decided that to test this theory 783.96 - I wanted to put 20 hours into practicing ukulele 787.636 - and see where it got. 789.819 - And so the first thing about playing the ukulele is, 793.635 - in order to practice, you have to have one, right? 797.701 - So, I got an ukulele and -- My lovely assistant? 801.791 - (Laughter) 804.526 - Thank you sir. I think I need the chord here. 811.58 - It's not just an ukulele, it's an electric ukulele. (Laughter) 815.569 - Yeah. 820.635 - So, the first couple hours are just like the first couple hours of anything. 825.195 - You have to get the tools that you are using to practice. 828.554 - You have to make sure they're available. 830.616 - My ukulele didn't come with strings attached. 832.582 - I had to figure out how to put those on. 834.548 - Like, that's kind of important, right? 836.515 - And learning how to tune, learning how to make sure 838.468 - that all of the things that need to be done 840.321 - in order to start practicing get done, right? 844.515 - Now, one of the things when I was ready to actually start practicing 851.187 - was I looked in online databases and songbooks for how to play songs. 855.996 - And they say, okay, ukuleles, you can play more than one string at a time, 859.088 - so you can play chords, that's cool, 860.969 - you are accompanying yourself, yay you. (Laughter) 864.242 - And when I started looking at songs, 868.356 - I had an ukulele chord book that had like hundreds of chords. 872.471 - Looking at this and \"Wow, that's intimidating\". 875.534 - But when you look at the actual songs, 877.859 - you see the same chords over and over, right? 882.71 - As it turns out, playing the ukulele is kind of like doing anything, 886.299 - There's a very small set of things that are really important 889.552 - and techniques that you'll use all the time. 892.422 - And in most songs you'll use four, maybe five chords, 898.42 - and that's it, that's the song. 900.229 - You don't have to know hundreds, as long as you know the four or the five. 904.993 - So, while I was doing my research, 906.813 - I found a wonderful little medley of pop songs 911.264 - by a band called Axis of Awesome. (Whistles) 916.178 - -- Somebody knows it. -- 919.199 - And what Axis of Awesome says is that you can learn, 923.418 - or you can play pretty much any pop song of the past five decades, 927.017 - if you know four chords, 928.685 - and those chords are G, D, Em and C. 933.062 - Four chords pump out every pop song ever, right? 937.931 - So I thought, this is cool! 939.401 - I would like to play every pop song ever. (Laughter) 942.584 - So, that was the first song I decided to learn, 945.627 - and I would like to actually share it with you. Ready? 949.445 - (Applause) Alright. 951.423 - (Music) 963.6 - (Singing) Just a small town girl, 966.104 - living in a lonely world, 968.878 - she took the midnight train going anywhere. 974.652 - I heard that you settled down, (Laughter) 978.209 - that you found a girl, 981.672 - that you're married now. 985.013 - Every night in my dreams (Laughter) 987.323 - I see you, I feel you, 990.496 - that is how I know you go on. (Laughter) 996.253 - I won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours. 1002.227 - 'Cause you were amazing, we did amazing things. 1007.6 - If I could, then I would, I'd go wherever you will -- 1012.682 - Can you feel the love tonight. (Laughter) 1018.244 - I can't live with or without you. 1023.4 - When I find myself -- 1025.19 - When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me, 1027.489 - Sometimes I feel like I don't have partner. No woman, no cry. 1031.865 - Yeah mama, this surely is a dream. 1033.504 - I come from a land down under. (Laughter) 1035.836 - Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong. 1038.863 - Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, (Laughter) 1042.253 - but here's my number, so call me 1046.413 - Hey sexy lady, op, op, op, op, oppan gangnam style. (Laughter) 1050.19 - It's time to say goodbye. 1055.932 - Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end. 1065.79 - (Singing and music ends) (Applause) 1076.911 - Thank you, thank you. 1083.013 - I love that song. (Laughter) 1087.395 - And I have a secret to share with you. 1090.499 - So, by playing that song for you, 1094.471 - I just hit my twentieth hour of practicing the ukulele. 1099.221 - (Applause) Thank you. 1104.933 - And so it's amazing, pretty much anything that you can think of, 1108.974 - what do you want to do. 1110.752 - The major barrier to learn something new is not intellectual, 1115.317 - it's not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things. 1120.998 - The major barrier's emotional. We're scared. 1124.753 - Feeling stupid doesn't feel good, 1127.014 - in the beginning of learning anything new 1129.275 - you feel really stupid. 1131.537 - So the major barrier's not intellectual, it's emotional. 1135.633 - But put 20 hours into anything. 1138.971 - It doesn't matter. What do you want to learn? 1141.377 - Do you want to learn a language? Want to learn how to cook? 1144.848 - Want to learn how to draw? 1147.114 - What turns you on? What lights you up? 1150.86 - Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20 hours. 1154.747 - Have fun. 1156.093 - (Applause)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 Introduction: Life-Changing Moment 1:11 The Challenge of Learning with Limited Time 3:51 The Myth of the 10,000-Hour Rule 6:31 The Reality of Learning: The 20-Hour Rule 9:41 The Four-Step Method for Efficient Learning 13:11 Applying the Method: Learning the Ukulele 15:51 Overcoming Emotional Barriers to Learning 17:31 Encouragement to Start Learning Anything"}]}

Google UX design certificates were released in 2021, 3.38 - and I took it in 2021. 5.266 - One year later, I became a product designer at eBay 8.203 - and fast forward to today, 9.672 - I'm no longer with eBay because I started 11.8 - my own design company, Aliena Design LLC 14.536 - Many things have changed in the past few 16.352 - years that made Google certificates less relevant than 18.776 - before, but still relevant enough for beginners. 21.632 - Hey everyone, I'm Aliena and 23.344 - welcome back to my channel. 24.824 - In this video I will break down Google 26.816 - certificates and whether it's relevant this year. 29.616 - Here are some major questions I want to answer. 31.736 - First, is Google UX design certificates job guaranteed? 35.478 - Absolutely not. 36.662 - Just by including the Google certificates on 38.87 - your resume doesn't really increase the chance 41.206 - of getting hired in this competitive time. 43.662 - And in fact, I've seen more and more people 45.678 - just clicking through the certificates in order to get 48.062 - their certificate, which actually decreases its value even more. 51.622 - If you want to take the course, take 53.342 - it for its value and its knowledge. 55.086 - Do not take it for the certificates. 57.318 - Will google be more open to hire 59.23 - you if you have the Google certificates? 61.558 - Unfortunately, no. 62.88 - Google hires and fires people 64.512 - based on its own timeline. 65.984 - If they are not hiring, then they are not hiring. 68.664 - In fact, when I was interviewing for Google, 70.84 - not a single person in the room even 72.496 - knew that there were Google certificates. 74.456 - Does Google UX design certificates teach 76.656 - you how Google does design? 78.544 - Not exactly. 79.808 - When I was taking the certificates, my 81.896 - biggest incentive was to learn how do 83.976 - big tech companies like Google do design. 86.392 - I even replaced all of my previous clients projects 89.648 - with my Google certificates personal projects just to make 93.192 - things things look more Google and look more thorough. 95.884 - Now that I have the experience working for big 98.084 - tech, and now that I have an entire network 100.244 - full of people working in tech, I can tell 102.572 - you that Google UX certificates will teach you the 104.932 - theoretical and academic way of doing design, which is, 108.012 - in the ideal world, the best thing to do. 110.38 - But that factors out a lot of real 112.868 - life elements and tech companies each uses a 115.692 - slightly different way to do design. 117.636 - If you are interested in exploring more about UX design 121.156 - and not yet fully committed to this career transition, I 124.292 - think Google UX design design is good for you. 126.424 - It is affordable and it touches on a lot of theories, 129.08 - techniques and knowledge you need to know as a designer. 131.76 - It breaks things down into bite size pieces 133.984 - like two to five minutes videos. 135.752 - So it makes perfect sense if you are a 137.6 - full time student or if you have a full 139.216 - time job and want to take this part time. 141.208 - I especially think certificate one to certificate five 144.465 - are very good for you. 145.768 - The content is spot on and it will take you through 148.416 - doing one personal project for a mobile app using Figma. 152.256 - So take course one to five. 154.106 - Course six will ask you to use Adobe XD. 156.634 - But something that happened after the release 158.746 - of the certificate is that Figma became 161.218 - the design monopoly of design tools space. 163.714 - So use Figma. 164.866 - Don't use Adobe XD in course six and course seven 168.138 - each requires you to do one more additional project. 170.986 - So that's very time consuming. 172.842 - You can just scan through it or skip it. 174.906 - And if you want to take this certificate, I highly 177.186 - recommend the Coursera plus plan because it not only gives 180.41 - you the access to this certificate, but there's also tons 183.672 - of coursera courses out there that you can take. 186.0 - For example, Google also has its data analysis program 189.576 - and project management program, which I both took, and 192.784 - they've both helped me in a very unexpected way. 196.152 - The link of that is in the description. 198.408 - Now, if you are very serious about transitioning into 201.376 - UX design, then I'll make it clear that just 204.24 - taking Google UX design certificate is not enough. 207.16 - Here's my story. 208.344 - I started by doing physical product 210.202 - design like designing chairs and desks. 212.546 - Then I did a UI design paper on smart home products 215.89 - like, you know, Alexa to control the lights and stuff. 219.394 - Then I learned design thinking from Stanford D school. 222.298 - Then I worked for Stanford D school as a design intern. 224.994 - Then I did a UI design 226.37 - internship in a startup in Tokyo. 228.514 - Then I did a product design 229.85 - internship in a Silicon Valley startup. 232.002 - Then I did a paper on brain computer interface UX 235.01 - design, like the Neuralink thing Elon Musk is doing. 238.016 - And finally I did the Google UX design certificate. 241.016 - And after that I did another design 243.0 - contractor role at a mortgage company. 245.272 - And then I started my personal 246.632 - brand which is this YouTube channel. 248.336 - And after all that I got a 250.192 - senior design contractor role at eBay. 252.304 - So please be patient and adopt to a growth mindset. 255.472 - This journey is not a three month journey. 258.24 - Even if you see a lot of YouTube videos 259.992 - saying that how they break into UX design in 262.392 - three months, there is a lot behind that story. 265.804 - So I don't think it's rational to expect that 267.964 - one program can make you a UX designer. 270.644 - I'm especially talking about becoming a UX designer 273.292 - or product designer in big tech companies. 275.364 - In the United States you can earn 277.04 - from 100K - 400K USD per year working as a 280.22 - UX or product designer at big tech companies. 282.684 - I think Netflix pays the most. 284.42 - If you want to know the step by step process of 286.692 - what you need to learn to become a designer in big 289.204 - tech company, right now I have a PDF guide. 291.708 - It is free in the description. 293.172 - You can grab that and after you download PDF, 295.672 - you will automatically be put into my email list. 298.032 - So you will hear from me from my email list as well. 300.472 - Let's say you finish the Google UX design certificates. 303.312 - What are some knowledge gaps you need to fill 305.456 - in between the certificates and getting a job? 308.368 - First is UI design skill and Figma. 311.016 - When a recruiter decides whether or not to 312.952 - hire you, they will open up your portfolio 315.336 - and they will scan through the project banner 317.576 - which includes the UI design of your project. 319.968 - If that UI banner has some 321.816 - major issue, you are immediately denied. 324.332 - And most designers have seen graduating from Google 327.012 - UX certificates have some major UI design issues. 330.188 - Because this course doesn't focus on UI design. 332.655 - You may be using accent color in the wrong spot. 335.036 - You may have multiple call to actions in the same page. 337.996 - A lot of people also use a body 339.692 - font size that is just way too large 341.668 - or you have problems aligning everything. 343.748 - I have a free Figma tutorial playlist that 345.804 - you can follow, so if you want to 347.404 - level up your Figma skill, check here. 349.814 - This is the free version. Of course. 351.534 - There's also a paid version which 353.142 - I will talk about it later. 354.414 - Second is product thinking and business sense. 357.422 - Most tech companies are calling their designers product designers 360.678 - these days because at the end of the 362.542 - day a designer designs for the product. 365.134 - Your title is whatever your company wants to 367.702 - call their designers, whether you are called a 369.782 - UI/ UX/ product/ web/ interaction designer. 373.414 - At the end of the day you need to design something. 375.734 - You need to deliver a Figma file that solves the 378.142 - user problem and help the business to generate more annual revenue 382.266 - All of my projects in eBay are related to 384.622 - pay per click advertising at eBay 386.571 - and if I can't think business, I won't get a job. 389.566 - Third is client project. 391.07 - It's very obvious that junior design positions 393.454 - are close to non existence right now 395.67 - and this is not just happening in 397.078 - the design industry, it is happening everywhere. 399.974 - Economic downturns plus the rise of AI will 402.886 - make junior positions less and less common. 405.638 - This is not something we can control, so 408.226 - instead of complaining about it, let us focus 410.626 - on something that we can control. 412.37 - In a time like this, it is crucial to use 415.018 - networking skills and personal branding to attract client projects. 418.954 - First, after working on a few client projects, 421.786 - you can position yourself as a senior designer 424.378 - and compete in the senior contractor design market. 427.434 - Fourth is portfolio. 428.946 - Google UX certificates provide you a template that 431.33 - you can follow for your portfolio, but I 433.194 - do not recommend using that template. 435.45 - That template is more like writing an essay. 437.982 - It lists out everything from top to bottom 440.326 - from start to finish of what you've done. 442.262 - It's an essay. 443.382 - It's not a pitch. 444.51 - A good design portfolio is a pitch. 446.398 - And you also need to pitch your portfolio to 448.558 - business stakeholders who have very little time and patience 451.518 - and may not even understand UX design. 453.694 - You need to make your portfolio and 455.062 - case studies strong and concise instead of 457.47 - a list of everything you can do. 459.03 - And of course I have a video on that.

Almost raw, just lightly grilled on one side. 365.88 - The sauce is made from\u00a0 scallop and A5 wagyu beef fat. 369.6 - It\u2019s sweet, creamy but needs\u00a0 a bit more acid for me. 373.32 - Still it\u2019s a really good one. 375.92 - Atlantic black cod served in a pork\u00a0 fat miso sauce topped with N25 caviar. 380.96 - Three bold players all fighting for attention. 384.28 - Interesting and creative dish. 386.24 - With it I enjoy an Austrian\u00a0 riesling by Nikolaihof. 389.52 - This one is the Fass Severin\u00a0 and it\u2019s certified biodynamic. 392.92 - On the way to the washroom I find myself in a\u00a0 little pocket with comforts from the real world. 398.0 - Football and snacks. 400.0 - Proving you can take the man out of Newcastle, 402.44 - but you can\u2019t take Newcastle out of the man. 405.56 - Next dish is Thai green curry. 407.68 - Made with shrimp caught in the\u00a0 waters just behind the restaurant. 411.88 - Powerful. 412.84 - Pop your eyes out acidity. 415.0 - I really enjoy this one. 417.16 - Next, lobster tail. 418.8 - It\u2019s served raw with a coriander\u00a0 and Thai dipping sauce. 422.0 - The sauce has lots of punch with\u00a0 salty, sweet, spicy and sour happening. 427.72 - So far, there have been\u00a0 some hiccups in the service. 430.6 - Some longer wait times for things here. 432.96 - A wet napkin there. 434.52 - but what they lack in experiece, they make\u00a0 up for with enthusianism and dilligence. 439.28 - I'm sure, it's hard to find highly trained\u00a0 servers out here at the end of the world. 444.12 - I'm not too worried about these little mistakes. 446.76 - This atmosphere, the music, makes me\u00a0 really feel like I\u2019m at a house party. 451.14 - and I\u2019m too busy having a good time. 453.84 - Next is lobster claw in satay sauce. 456.48 - It\u2019s served with peanut\u00a0 brittle and fresh lime zest. 459.8 - The lobster is firm but tender, and the\u00a0 sauce has bold flavors with sweet undertones. 465.36 - For wine we try something interesting. 468.0 - This wine is from French producer Dopff. 470.44 - It\u2019s an aromatic wine that\u00a0 smells a lot like lychee. 473.36 - And it\u2019s perfectly matched for our last\u00a0 spicy dish inspired by Southeast Asia 478.52 - This is Singapore chili crab served\u00a0 with a steamed bun that is deep fried. 482.88 - The crab is good with nice acidity\u00a0 and spice but this bun nice and soft. 487.71 - Very good. 487.72 - As we go from seafood to meat,\u00a0 we first need a palette cleanser. 491.4 - This shaved ice made from pickled ginger juice. 494.32 - It\u2019s really nice and it works like a charm. 496.8 - Do you like what you see so far? 498.64 - If you do please make sure you hit subscribe. 501.04 - So you never miss the boat on a future episode. 504.28 - Our first meat dish is deep fried veal sweet\u00a0 bread with ranch topped with N25 caviar. 509.96 - This was excellent. 511.76 - Big flavors thanks to lots of fat. 515.28 - This is duck liver ice cream. 517.36 - It\u2019s served with apple in syrup and fresh form 519.52 - along with puffed spelt and a spelt biscuit. 522.52 - Grated over the top is smoked veal. 525.36 - It\u2019s salty, it\u2019s sweet and\u00a0 plays with a ton of textures. 529.28 - With this we try Brannland\u2019s Apple Ice 21 vintage. 532.6 - This is a still ice cider but\u00a0 it\u2019s as sweet as any dessert wine. 537.24 - As you may have noticed by now, the menu has been\u00a0 fat fuelled and protein obsessed, as advertised. 542.96 - As much as I like a nice cut of meat, 545.32 - a few vegetables would be\u00a0 nice to lighten things up. 548.12 - But I\u2019m not going to hold my breath. 550.32 - This is pigeon in a cheriaki sauce with chocolate. 553.16 - Cheriyaki is a teriyaki\u00a0 flavored with cherry and garlic. 557.2 - This one is really interesting. 559.12 - I still remember the amazing flavor combination. 562.36 - Very tender, exploding with flavor, 564.84 - I just wish it was pre-sliced\u00a0 so I could focus on it more. 569.2 - What did not distract me from this dish was wine. 571.84 - I didn\u2019t have any. 573.56 - Our next dish is duck made Chinese style. 576.64 - Cooked for 24 hours and then\u00a0 made crispy with hot oil. 580.48 - On the side a classic garnish\u00a0 sliced cucumber and sweet onion. 584.52 - And over the top is a traditional\u00a0 Chinese Barbeque sauce. 588.32 - For wine we go with a 2017 California Pinot Noir. 593.4 - Traditional Thai salad with duck and pigeon 597.56 - This is lamb spare rib cooked\u00a0 low and slow for 36 hours. 601.16 - Then seared and charred over birch wood. 603.24 - and brushed with a mint soy glaze. 605.08 - Topped with shallots and fresh mint. 607.24 - It tastes as good as it looks 609.56 - We have to get our hands dirty,\u00a0 but it\u2019s totally worth it. 613.04 - Outstanding. 614.84 - Next is sirloin with shiitake\u00a0 mushrooms cooked in beef fat. 618.68 - Over the top is a duck liver custard. 621.12 - Super rich, super flavorful. 623.28 - Nicely executed dish. 625.28 - At this point, the DJ has shifted gears. 627.92 - Gone are the likes of Iggy\u00a0 Pop and the Rolling Stones. 630.72 - Now we are into high-octane dance\u00a0 music and the speakers are cranked. 634.68 - This next one is a bit strange 636.36 - First they put this down in front of us. 638.84 - This is like McDonald\u2019s with a Michelin twist. 641.4 - The one-bite burger is A5\u00a0 Japanese beef with fixings. 644.64 - The dessert is ice cream with caviar and syrup. 647.68 - I liked both of them but the\u00a0 presentation came out of nowhere. 651.76 - Next we have desserts. 653.44 - This is yorkshire rhubarb with duck\u00a0 liver custard and topped with spelt. 657.0 - The light tart rhubarb and the rich, heavy\u00a0 custard make a surprisingly nice couple 661.52 - and move quite well together. 663.72 - Finally a date cake with vanilla\u00a0 ice cream and traditional miso 667.36 - made with Japanese soy beans. 669.0 - It\u2019s not as sweet as it\u00a0 looks, but was really good. 671.88 - The ice cream is excellent quality. 674.56 - Then, just as we are finishing. 676.8 - This happens. 678.12 - I thought something had caught fire for a second. 680.96 - Then I saw this 683.6 - and now ALL of the lights are going. 686.64 - Amazing. 687.32 - It totally fits the personality of this place. 690.2 - What a way to finish. 692.28 - When it\u2019s time to go, we pick up the bill. 694.76 - As we pre-paid for our meals and\u00a0 accomodation this bill is just the drinks. 698.72 - Which comes to just over 1200 euro. 701.6 - I had an absolute blast here. 703.64 - The DJ and the house party atmosphere\u00a0 really makes this place a joy. 708.04 - My front row seat was the perfect\u00a0 place to watch chef Ward do his thing. 712.32 - The chef cooks with freedom. 714.56 - However I missed the vegetables and the freshness, 717.12 - and felt the menu was too one-sided. 719.28 - That said, they delivered on what was promised. 722.28 - On the service side, I see room for improvement. 725.2 - At times, the wait was a bit much, and\u00a0 my glass stayed empty for too long. 730.08 - But they are enthusiastic. 732.36 - And that\u2019s the beauty of it. 734.16 - They are just doing what they love. 736.52 - Chef Ward told me that he wants to have a\u00a0 restaurant where even he would gladly dine. 741.0 - With the fire, the protein, the party, and even\u00a0 a bit of football, it seems like he has done it. 747.2 - When I told him I was going to be honest, 749.4 - and mention the small mistakes in this video, 751.64 - Chef Ward told me: 752.96 - \u201cI\u2019m glad you were here, but I\u2019m\u00a0 not really interested in the video. 756.24 - I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll watch it. 758.24 - Say what you have to say.\u201d 759.6 - He was smiling and he added: 761.6 - \"I don't give a f***\" 762.64 - I love this man and his honesty. 764.44 - Chef, in case you\u2019re watching, I hope you like it. 768.0 - On New Year\u2019s Eve in Dubai, I had a\u00a0 chance to chat with Chef Bjorn Franzen. 772.08 - We were talking about what\u00a0 was important in a restaurant 775.16 - and Bjorn shared his number one. 777.44 - A restaurant should be fun. 780.12 - Ynyshir was fun indeed. 782.68 - This fun place full of honest people? 784.7 - Absolutely. 785.08 - I for one, am going to miss them. 787.56 - And that does it for this episode 789.0 - Thank you for joining me, 790.28 - if you like this video, hit subscribe! 792.6 - See you next time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Setting the Scene 0:30 -

Today, I'm going to try to explain 7.359 - two fundamental concepts of American government that students and citizens often confuse. 11.75 - Team Jacob and Team Edward. No. Separation of powers and checks and balances. Team Jacob! 17.13 - [Theme Music] 25.59 - So separation of powers is really simple. The national government is divided into three 29.3 - separate branches: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. 33.07 - I put them in this order because that's the way the Constitution has them. And I'm not 36.2 - going to argue with the Constitution, except for that stupid 3/5ths of a person thing. 39.46 - So the legislative branch comes first, because it's supposed to be the most important branch, 43.03 - and Article I is the longest and most detailed of the 7 Articles in the Constitution. The 46.73 - main job of the legislature is to make laws. The secondary job is to say, \"No, it's your 50.829 - fault.\" \"No, it's your fault!\" \"No, it's your fault! I'm going home, I have to campaign.\" 55.19 - Then we have the executive branch, and here the Constitution is a little less helpful. 58.59 - Article II Section I states \"The executive power shall be vested in a President of the 62.719 - United States of America.\" The executive branch is obviously more than one guy or girl. The 67.59 - executive branch is in charge of executing the law, which basically means carrying them 71.159 - out. The President is like the CEO of the US, making sure that the government governs. 75.03 - Interestingly, the President's power as executive is found in the Oath of Office. \"I do solemnly 79.0 - swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United 83.549 - States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution 88.67 - of the United States.\" Ruh ruh ruh! 91.32 - Wait, Stan, I just gave the Presidential Oath of Office, so I'm President now, right? Totally. 95.56 - Oh, elections, yeah, we didn't have those. 98.64 - Last and, in the eyes of many, least, is the judicial branch. The job of the judiciary, 103.04 - also sometimes called \"the Courts,\" which I'm going to also call \"the Courts,\" because 106.07 - judiciary is really hard to say, is to interpret the law, to explain what it means. Article 110.29 - III, which describes the judicia- the courts is even shorter than Article II. It only has 115.09 - 3 sections instead of 4, and the courts today don't really look like this description. 118.52 - Here is the first sentence of Article III Section I: \"The judicial power of the United 123.299 - States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress 128.319 - may from time to time ordain and establish.\" At least the Framers realized that the entire 133.44 - United States would probably need more than one court. But notice right there in the sentence, 137.2 - that Congress has the power to create all other courts. 139.75 - And this lead us nicely into the second important concept of American government - checks and 143.16 - balances. Yeah, that was a segue right into it. It was a nice job, by me. I'm going to 148.11 - need a little help explaining checks and balances, so let's do that part in the Clone Zone. 153.05 - Checks and balances is a confusing term because it implies two things. But really, it would 157.29 - be better to think of them as checks that balance, although that might be confusing 160.61 - to people who actually try to balance their checkbooks. Anyways, the point here is that 164.349 - each of the branches has the power to limit, or check, the other two and this creates a 168.03 - balance between the three separate powers. In the same way that the Constitution lays 171.599 - out the legislature in the greatest detail, it also gives the legislature the greatest 174.959 - number of checks on the other branches. Legislative clone... 178.0 - Legislative Clone: So the Framers of the Constitution were really concerned about the President 181.83 - becoming a tyrannical figure a la King George III. That guy was a jerk. So the Constitution 186.739 - gives the legislature a lot of power over the Executive. The House of Representatives 190.83 - can impeach the President, then the Senate can remove the President from office, but 194.379 - only if two thirds of the Senators vote for impeachment. The Senate can also check the 197.97 - President's appointment of judges and officials by rejecting them. This is known as advice and consent. 202.91 - Either branch of Congress can investigate executive activities and officers. If the 207.51 - President vetoes a law, Congress, with a two thirds vote in both houses, can override the 211.97 - veto. Congress can also refuse to pass laws that the executive wants, and probably most 216.099 - important, they can refuse to appropriate funds for executive programs. You might think 220.69 - that since the judiciary is the third and presumably least important branch, Congress 224.61 - would have fewer checks on it. But that would be wrong! 227.09 - Here are the ways that the legislative branch can limit the judicial branch: Congress can 231.069 - impeach and remove judges as it can do with the President. Congress can be a bunch of 234.83 - jerks sometimes. Huh, that's me. Heheheh. Senates can reject judicial nominees, which 240.11 - is a check on judges before they even get there. Congress can change the federal court 244.4 - system by adding or taking away courts like it says in Article III. And it can change 248.379 - the jurisdiction of federal courts. Congress can pass new laws that override the Supreme 252.269 - Court decisions, as long as the decisions aren't based on the Constitution. Don't want 256.15 - to do that, no. And as a very last, super drastic resort, Congress can propose Amendments 261.299 - to the Constitution, as it did with the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, overruling the Dred Scott decision. 266.96 - Craig: Wow, legislative clone. Looks like the Framers were so scared of an all-powerful 270.69 - super president that they gave Congress most of the power. Executive Clone, you know, I'll 274.59 - be Executive Clone because I'm basically president of the clones. 277.37 - The executive branch can check the power of the legislature in the following ways: the 280.89 - president can veto Congress' laws so that they don't go into effect. The president can 284.22 - call Congress into a special session, but he can't make them pass new laws. The executive 288.24 - branch carries out the laws, and may do so in ways that are contrary to what Congress 291.75 - wanted. Although this rarely happens, the vice president is given power to break ties 295.58 - in the Senate, which is one of his only real powers other than embarrassing the president. 299.21 - The president nominates Supreme Court justices, and this can change the way the courts work. 303.259 - He also nominates federal court judges, and this shapes the entire court system. The president 307.32 - can pardon people convicted by the courts, which cancels out their judgments. The president 311.12 - can also, in his capacity to carry out the laws, refuse to carry out court decisions. 315.36 - So you can see, even with a number of checks that it has, the executive branch is weaker than the legislature. 319.99 - Judiciary Clone: But not as weak as the judiciary branch. Many political scientists consider the judiciary 326.009 - the weakest branch because without legislative and executive action, it doesn't 329.61 - have a whole lot to do. Being the weakest branch, the judiciary also has the fewest 334.33 - checks on the other two branches. 336.28 - Here's what it can do: The judiciary checks the legislature by declaring its laws unconstitutional. 341.229 - The Chief Justice presides over impeachment trials, and sometimes he gets to wear a special 345.27 - robe when this happens. Perk of the job, it's a perk of the job. It's really nice. 349.58 - And the judiciary checks the executive branch by declaring executive actions unconstitutional. 354.34 - A really good example of this was Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company vs. Sawyer, a super 359.16 - important case. Look it up, look it up! 361.82 - The court also issues warrants in federal crime cases, and again presides over impeachment 366.039 - trials in the Senate. But the big check that the courts have is invalidating laws and executive 370.819 - actions. We'll talk about how courts actually do this and where they got this power in a later episode. 375.98 - Craig: No, I'll talk about it in a later episode, okay? Let's go back to the regular desk. 380.759 - Judiciary Clone: You're out of order! 382.2 - Craig: Thanks clones. Now some of you are probably saying, Craig, this is very helpful 385.229 - information but why do we have checks and balances in the first place? To you I say, 389.0 - \"Stop talking to your computers, that's weird!\" I also say, \"Let's go to the Thought Bubble.\" 392.85 - So the Framers of the Constitution were terrified of a tyrannical central government that would 396.289 - destroy people's rights like they felt the British had. The powers of the national government 399.86 - are separated, and each branch are able to check others because this makes it more difficult 403.58 - for the government to act in ways that harm the acts and interests of the citizens. 406.949 - One of the best explanations of this comes from, you guessed it, the Federalists Papers. 410.63 - In this case, Federalist 51, which was written by James Madison, who also wrote a lot of 414.55 - the Constitution and became president, so he kind of knows what he's talking about. 417.699 - And really, it's kind of a shame that he's not on our money because Americans would pay 420.49 - him more attention, and they would also pay him, literally. 423.65 - In Federalists 51, the title which also contains the phrase, \"checks and balances,\" Madison 428.08 - wrote, \"But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in same 432.52 - department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional 437.259 - means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. It may be a reflection on human 442.62 - nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what 447.24 - is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature.\" 450.8 - That's right, he wrote with an accent. Don't know how that's possible. Thanks, Thought Bubble. 454.52 - Madison was talking about checks and balances; I'll leave it up to you to decide 457.819 - if human nature requires that we build safeguards into our government to protect us from 461.04 - our leaders. But Madison thought so, and I think so too. But this isn't about me; this is about government. 466.88 - And it's helpful to remember that when people tell you that the Framers of the Constitution 470.19 - were infallible, James Madison actually that they were outfallible, or just fallible. Anyways, 476.289 - see you next time. I'm so fallible. 478.669 - Crash Course Government and Politics is produced in associate with PBS Digital Studios.

Admittedly, this wasn\u2019t the French flag until 1794, 7.97 - but we just felt like he looked good in stripes. As does this guy. Huh? 11.28 - So, while the American Revolution is considered a pretty good thing, the French Revolution 14.74 - is often seen as a bloody, anarchic mess, which... 16.999 - Mr. Green, Mr. Green! I bet, like always, it\u2019s way more complicated than that. 20.929 - Actually no. It was pretty terrible. Also, like a lot of revolutions, in the end it exchanged 24.619 - an authoritarian regime for an authoritarian regime. But even if the revolution was a mess, 29.07 - its ideas changed human history - far more, I will argue, than the American Revolution. 33.69 - [theme music] 42.54 - Right, so France in the 18th century was a rich and populous country, but it had a systemic 46.809 - problem collecting taxes because of the way its society was structured. They had a system 51.06 - with kings and nobles we now call the Ancien R\u00e9gime. Thank you, three years of high school French. 56.76 - And for most French people, it sucked, because the people with the money - the nobles and 60.82 - the clergy - never paid taxes. So by 1789, France was deeply in debt thanks to their 65.28 - funding the American Revolution - thank you, France; we will get you back in World Wars 69.26 - I and II. And King Louis XVI was spending half of his national budget to service the federal debt. 74.4 - Louis tried to reform this system under various finance ministers. He even called for democracy 78.45 - on a local level, but all attempts to fix it failed and soon France basically declared 82.689 - bankruptcy. This nicely coincided with hailstorms that ruined a year\u2019s harvest, thereby raising food prices 87.74 - and causing widespread hunger, which really made the people of France angry, because they love to eat. 92.2 - Meanwhile, the King certainly did not look broke, as evidenced by his well-fed physique 96.67 - and fancy footwear. He and his wife Marie Antoinette also got to live in the very nice 100.39 - Palace at Versailles thanks to God\u2019s mandate, but Enlightenment thinkers like Kant were 104.189 - challenging the whole idea of religion, writing things like: \u201cThe main point of enlightenment 108.829 - is of man\u2019s release from his self-caused immaturity, primarily in matters of religion.\u201d 114.289 - So basically the peasants were hungry, the intellectuals were beginning to wonder whether 117.8 - God could or should save the King, and the nobility were dithering about, eating foie 122.329 - gras and songbirds, failing to make meaningful financial reform. 125.89 - In response to the crisis, Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates General, the closest 129.89 - thing that France had to a national parliament, which hadn\u2019t met since 1614. The Estates 134.01 - General was like a super parliament made up of representatives from the First Estate, 137.34 - the nobles, the Second Estate, the clergy, and the Third Estate, everyone else. 141.84 - The Third Estate showed up with about 600 representatives, the First and Second Estates 145.36 - both had about 300, and after several votes, everything was deadlocked, and then the Third 149.76 - Estate was like, \u201cYou know what? Forget you guys. We\u2019re gonna leave and we\u2019re 153.599 - gonna become our own National Assembly.\u201d 156.4 - This did not please King Louis XVI. So when the new National Assembly left the room for 160.15 - a break, he locked the doors, and he was like, \"Sorry, guys, you can't go in there. And if 164.4 - you can't assemble, how you gonna be a National Assembly?\" 167.65 - Shockingly, the Third Estate representatives were able to find a different room in France, 171.349 - this time an indoor tennis court where they swore the famous Tennis Court Oath. And they 175.409 - agreed not to give up until a French constitution was established. 178.909 - So then Louis XVI responded by sending troops to Paris primarily to quell uprisings over 183.06 - food shortages, but the revolutionaries saw this as a provocation, so they responded by 187.04 - seizing the Bastille Prison on July 14th, which, coincidentally, is also Bastille Day. 190.489 - The Bastille was stormed ostensibly to free prisoners - although there were only seven 193.78 - in jail at the time - but mostly to get guns. 196.019 - But the really radical move in the National Assembly came on August 4, when they abolished 199.93 - most of the Ancien R\u00e9gime - feudal rights, tithes, privileges for nobles, unequal taxation, 205.56 - they were all abolished - in the name of writing a new constitution. 208.799 - And then, on August 26th, the National Assembly proclaimed the Declaration of Rights of Man 212.799 - and Citizen, which laid out a system of rights that applied to every person, and made those 216.47 - rights integral to the new constitution. That\u2019s quite different from the American bill of 220.409 - rights, which was, like, begrudgingly tacked on at the end and only applied to non-slaves. 223.799 - The DoRoMaC, as I called it in high school, declared that everyone had the right to liberty, 228.5 - property, and security - rights that the French Revolution would do an exceptionally poor 233.22 - job of protecting, but as noted last week, the same can be argued for many other supposedly 237.209 - more successful revolutions. Okay, let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 240.25 - Meanwhile, back at Versailles, Louis XVI was still King of France, and it was looking like 244.079 - France might be a constitutional monarchy. Which might've meant that the royal family 247.64 - could hang on to their awesome house, but then, in October of 1789, a rumor started 252.989 - that Marie Antoinette was hoarding grain somewhere inside the palace. 257.29 - And in what became known as the Women's March, a bunch of armed peasant women stormed the 261.47 - palace and demanded that Louis and Marie Antoinette move from Versailles to Paris. Which they 267.55 - did, because everyone is afraid of armed peasant women. And this is a nice reminder that to 271.52 - many people at the time, the French Revolution was not primarily about fancy Enlightenment 276.66 - ideas; it was mostly about lack of food and a political system that made economic contractions 281.71 - hardest on the poor. 283.22 - Now, a good argument can be made that this first phase of the revolution wasn\u2019t all 286.85 - that revolutionary. The National Assembly wanted to create a constitutional monarchy; 291.03 - they believed that the king was necessary for a functioning state and they were mainly 294.78 - concerned that the voters and office holders be men of property. Only the most radical 299.56 - wing, the Jacobins, called for the creation of a republic. But things were about to get 303.32 - much more revolutionary - and also worse for France. 306.93 - First, the Jacobins had a huge petition drive that got a bit unruly, which led troops controlled 311.24 - not by the King but by the National Assembly to fire on the crowd, killing 50 people. And 316.74 - that meant that the National Assembly, which had been the revolutionary voice of the people, 321.03 - had killed people in an attempt to reign in revolutionary fervor. You see this a lot throughout 325.94 - history during revolutions. What looked like radical hope and change suddenly becomes \"The 331.12 - Man\" as increasingly radical ideas are embraced. Thanks, Thought Bubble. 335.04 - Meanwhile, France\u2019s monarchical neighbors were getting a little nervous about all this 338.21 - republic business, especially Leopold II, who in addition to being the not holy, not 342.98 - Roman, and not imperial Holy Roman Emperor, was Marie Antoinette\u2019s brother. I should 347.27 - note, by the way, that at this point, the Holy Roman Empire was basically just Austria. 350.4 - Also, like a lot of monarchs, Leopold II liked the idea of monarchies, and he wanted to keep 354.59 - his job as a person who gets to stand around wearing a dress, pointing at nothing, owning 358.45 - winged lion-monkeys made out of gold. And who can blame him? So he and King William Frederick II 363.28 - of Prussia together issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, which promised to restore the French monarchy. 368.8 - At this point, Louis and the National Assembly developed a plan: Let\u2019s invade Austria. 373.32 - The idea was to plunder Austria\u2019s wealth and maybe steal some Austrian grain to shore 376.99 - up French food supplies, and also, you know, spread revolutionary zeal. But what actually 380.73 - happened is that Prussia joined Austria in fighting the French. And then Louis encouraged 385.21 - the Prussians, which made him look like an enemy of the revolution, which, of course, 388.49 - he was. And as a result, the Assembly voted to suspend the monarchy, have new elections 392.47 - in which everyone could vote (as long as they were men), and create a new republican constitution. 397.41 - Soon, this Convention decided to have a trial for Louis XVI, who was found guilty and, by 401.01 - one vote, sentenced to die via guillotine. Which made it difficult for Austria and Prussia 405.59 - to restore him to the throne. Oh, it\u2019s time for the open letter? 411.92 - An Open Letter to the Guillotine. But first, let\u2019s see what\u2019s in the secret compartment today. 416.16 - Oh, there\u2019s nothing. Oh my gosh, Stan! Jeez. That\u2019s not funny! 420.66 - Dear Guillotine, I can think of no better example of Enlightenment thinking run amok. Dr. Joseph Guillotine, 425.93 - the inventor of the guillotine, envisioned it as an egalitarian way of dying. They said 430.31 - the guillotine was humane and it also made no distinction between rich or poor, noble 435.05 - or peasant. It killed equally. 437.34 - You were also celebrated for taking the torture out of execution. But I will remind you, you 440.9 - did not take the dying out of execution. Unfortunately for you, France hasn\u2019t executed anyone since 445.83 - 1977. But you\u2019ll be happy to know that the last legal execution in France was via guillotine. 451.65 - Plus, you\u2019ve always got a future in horror movies. 453.49 - Best wishes, John Green 454.94 - The death of Louis XVI marks the beginning of The Terror, the best known or at least 458.2 - the most sensational phase of the revolution. I mean, if you can kill the king, you can 461.46 - kill pretty much anyone, which is what the government did under the leadership of the 465.0 - Committee of Public Safety (Motto: We suck at protecting public safety), led by Maximilien Robespierre. 470.93 - The terror saw the guillotining of 16,000 enemies of the revolution including Marie 475.23 - \u201cI never actually said Let them eat cake\u201d Antoinette and Maximilien Robespierre himself, 479.67 - who was guillotined in the month of Thermidor in the year Two. 482.71 - Alright, so while France was broke and fighting in like nine wars, the Committee of Public 485.97 - Safety changed the measurements of time because, you know, the traditional measurements are 489.38 - so irrational and religion-y. So they renamed all the months and decided that every day 492.95 - would have 10 hours and each hour 100 minutes. 495.13 - And then, after the Terror, the revolution pulled back a bit and another new constitution 499.16 - was put into place, this one giving a lot more power to wealthy people. At this point, 502.8 - France was still at war with Austria and Britain, wars that France ended up winning, largely 506.98 - thanks to a little corporal named Napoleon Bonaparte. 509.85 - The war was backdrop to a bunch of coups and counter coups that I won\u2019t get into right 512.61 - now because they were very complicated, but the last coup that we\u2019ll talk about, in 515.86 - 1799, established Napoleon Bonaparte as the First Consul of France. And it granted him 521.95 - almost unlimited executive power under yet another constitution. And when he was declared 526.63 - First Consul of France, Napoleon proclaimed \"Citizens! The revolution is established on 530.95 - the principals with which it began. It is over.\" By which he presumably meant that France\u2019s 535.25 - government had gone all the way from here to here to here. 538.58 - As with the American revolution, it\u2019s easy to conclude that France\u2019s revolution wasn\u2019t 542.55 - all that revolutionary. I mean, Napoleon was basically an emperor and, in some ways, he 546.28 - was even more of an absolute monarch than Louis XVI had been. Gradually the nobles came 550.09 - back to France, although they had mostly lost their special privileges. The Catholic Church 553.51 - returned, too, although much weaker because it had lost land and the ability to collect tithes. 557.38 - And when Napoleon himself fell, France restored the monarchy, and except for a four-year period, 561.79 - between 1815 and 1870, France had a king who was either a Bourbon or a Bonaparte. 567.85 - Now, these were no longer absolute monarchs who claimed that their right to rule came from 570.98 - God; they were constitutional monarchs of the kind that the revolutionaries of 1789 575.19 - had originally envisioned. But the fact remains that France had a king again, and a nobility, 578.23 - and an established religion and it was definitely not a democracy or a republic. 583.07 - And perhaps this is why the French Revolution is so controversial and open to interpretation. 587.15 - Some argue the revolution succeeded in spreading enlightenment ideals even if it didn\u2019t bring 590.55 - democracy to France. Others argue that the real legacy of the Revolution wasn\u2019t the 593.99 - enhancement of liberty, but of state power. 596.21 - Regardless, I\u2019d argue that the French Revolution was ultimately far more revolutionary than 599.98 - its American counterpart. I mean, in some ways, America never had an aristocracy, but 603.78 - in other ways it continued to have one - the French enlightenment thinker, Diderot, felt 607.73 - that Americans should \u201cfear a too unequal division of wealth resulting in a small number 611.96 - of opulent citizens and a multitude of citizens living in misery.\u201d And the American Revolution 616.34 - did nothing to change that polarization of wealth. 618.89 - What made the French Revolution so radical was its insistence on the universality of 623.5 - its ideals. I mean, look at Article 6 of the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen: 627.38 - \u201cLaw is the expression of the general will. Every citizen has a right to participate personally, 632.3 - or through his representative, in its foundation. It must be the same for all, whether it protects or punishes.\u201d 638.66 - Those are radical ideas, that the laws come from citizens, not from kings or gods, and 643.28 - that those laws should apply to everyone equally. That\u2019s a long way from Hammurabi - and in 648.09 - truth, it\u2019s a long way from the slaveholding Thomas Jefferson. 650.61 - In the 1970s, Chinese President Zhou Enlai was asked what the affects of the French Revolution 655.13 - had been. And he said, \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say.\u201d And in a way, it still is. The 659.34 - French Revolution asked new questions about the nature of people\u2019s rights and the derivation 663.68 - of those rights. And we\u2019re still answering those questions and sorting through how our 667.07 - answers should shape society today - must government be of the people to be for the 671.46 - people? Do our rights derive from nature or from God or from neither? And what are those rights? 676.6 - As William Faulkner said, \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d Thanks for 680.74 - watching.

Hi, I\u2019m Thomas Frank, this is Crash Course Study Skills, and today we\u2019re going to look at how to take great notes \u2013 and you're probably gonna wanna write that down. 7.24 - [Theme Music] 16.44 - Why focus on your notes? 17.8 - Well, simply put, when it comes to learning and retaining information, output is just as important as input. 23.64 - When you\u2019re first learning a fact or a concept, you\u2019re intaking new information; 27.28 - but, to retain that information for a long time, you need to store it in a place that you can easily access later on, and you need to put it in your own words. 34.9 - Now, before we talk about specific note-taking systems, what information you should actually record in your notes, 39.66 - and whether or not it\u2019s helpful to blend them up and drink 'em like a milkshake, 42.179 - let\u2019s start with what\u2019s going to set you up for success in the first place: 45.2 - showing up to class prepared with the right tools. 47.52 - There are three routes you can go when selecting those tools: paper, computer, or arm. 51.53 - What\u2019s the best option? 52.729 - Well, unless you\u2019re that guy from Memento, we can probably narrow it down to either paper or computer. 57.36 - Between those two, there\u2019s been a debate going on for years, but we do have some recent scientific evidence that we can turn to for some hard answers. 63.9 - According to a study done at Princeton University in 2014, students who took notes on a 15-minute lecture using a laptop wrote an average of 310 words, 72.22 - while those who wrote on paper only averaged 173. 75.94 - So it seems typing your notes definitely does give you a speed advantage. 79.94 - The downside to becoming the metaphorical Speed Racer of note-taking, though, was that these same students were able to recall less information when tested later on. 87.14 - So why does this happen? 88.6 - Well, the root of the problem lies in the fact that the computer note-takers were much more likely to record what was being presented word-for-word. 94.44 - Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 96.0 - When you\u2019re paying attention to a lecture, there are two aspects to the information being presented. 100.08 - Since complex information is communicated through language \u2013 be it written or spoken \u2013 104.52 - we get both the syntax (like the letters and sounds that make up the words) as well as the meaning. 109.78 - When you\u2019re typing out your notes, the speed advantage enables you to record a much more complete version of what your teacher is saying. 115.78 - However, your working memory \u2013 the part of your memory that deals with the information you\u2019re currently intaking \u2013 120.6 - can only deal with so much at one time. 122.62 - Current cognitive science research puts that amount at around four \u201cchunks\u201d of information, which we\u2019ll talk about in another video. 128.5 - The combination of that recording speed advantage and your built-in mental processing limit 132.08 - can lead you to devote more mental resources to the syntax of the message \u2013 those pesky letters and sounds \u2013 and less to the actual meaning. 139.38 - As a result, you learn less in class and you create more work for yourself later on. 143.22 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. 144.36 - So, does this mean that a pen and paper always beats your laptop? 147.19 - Well, not necessarily; 148.6 - now that you know that the speed increase you get through typing has a downside, 151.78 - you can just resolve to type less and pay more attention to the meaning of the message while you\u2019re in class. 157.12 - Still, paper does have an implicit advantage, as it requires less self-control. 161.52 - Your long-hand writing speed automatically limits how much you pay attention to the syntax, 166.1 - and \u2013 as a bonus \u2013 you don\u2019t have to worry about being tempted to go on Facebook in the middle of class either. 170.45 - Regardless of what tool you decide to choose, though, make sure you come into class prepared. 174.66 - If you\u2019re using paper, have a well organized notebook with plenty of blank space, as well as a good quality pen that you enjoy writing with. 180.5 - And if you decide that a computer fits your style better, find a good note-taking app 184.4 - like Evernote, or OneNote, Dropbox Paper, or any other that fits your fancy. 187.95 - You should also close out of any apps or websites that aren\u2019t relevant to the lecture \u2013 191.18 - that\u2019ll help you stay focused, though you still might have to work to ignore that guy in front of you who\u2019s taking a quiz on Buzzfeed to figure out his Hogwarts house. 197.13 - I\u2019m a Ravenclaw, by the way \u2013 though that\u2019s just what a Slytherin would say, isn\u2019t it? 201.6 - Anyway, now that you\u2019re prepped and equipped with the right tools, what exactly should you be recording with them? 206.55 - After all, you can\u2019t just record everything. 208.66 - As the famous mathematician Eric Temple Bell noted, 211.24 - \u201cThe map is not the thing mapped.\u201d 213.6 - Just like a map is only useful if it summarizes and simplifies what it represents, 217.4 - your notes are a useful reviewing tool only when there\u2019s a high signal-to-noise ratio. 221.6 - That means they\u2019ve got to be packed with the information you need to know for tests and later application, and devoid of anything that doesn\u2019t matter. 227.54 - It\u2019s a bit hard to make specific recommendations here, since there are so many different subjects and classes in which you\u2019ll need your note-taking skills; 233.38 - however, we can put forth some general guidelines that will point you in the right direction. 237.34 - First and foremost, gauge each class you\u2019re taking early on. 240.26 - Carefully look at the syllabus, pay attention to any study guides or review materials you can get your hands on, 244.66 - and make mental notes about different types of questions you see on early quizzes and tests. 249.38 - Additionally, any time you hear your professor say something like, \u201cThis is important, pay attention,\u201d in lecture, that\u2019s a cue to take extra-careful notes. 256.4 - A lot of my friends in school thought it was a cue to take a nap, but they were wrong. 259.84 - Beyond that, whether you\u2019re sitting in class or going through a reading assignment in your textbook, you\u2019ll want to pay special attention to things like: 265.22 - Big ideas \u2013 you know, summaries, overviews, or conclusions 268.42 - Bullet lists (like this one) Terms and definitions and Examples 273.1 - And examples are doubly important, especially in classes where you have to apply concepts and formulas to problems, like in math or physics. 280.2 - You can probably remember times when an example presented in class made perfect sense, 284.84 - but then a later homework problem using the same exact concept completely stumped you. 289.12 - There\u2019s a big difference between being able to follow along while someone else solves a problem and having the chops to solve it on your own. 295.94 - But by recording every detail of the examples you see in class \u2013 299.36 - as well as making side notes about why the concepts being used work \u2013 302.78 - you\u2019ll have a lot more ammunition to work with while you\u2019re tackling those homework problems. 306.06 - Now that we\u2019ve covered the elements of good, useful notes, let\u2019s get into the specifics of how to take them. 310.88 - Now there are plenty of note-taking systems out there, each with their own pros and cons, 314.91 - but with this video we\u2019re just going to focus on three: 317.75 - The Outline method, the Cornell method, and the Mind-Mapping method. 321.25 - The Outline method is probably the simplest one of them all, and it\u2019s likely the one you\u2019re most familiar with. 325.7 - To use it, you just record the details of the lecture or book you\u2019re reading in a bullet list. 329.5 - Each main point will be a top-level bullet, and underneath it you\u2019ll indent further and further as you add details and specifics. 335.28 - The syllabus I wrote for this very Crash Course series is a good example of outline-style notes. 340.1 - Each video\u2019s outline has several top-level bullets, followed by several levels of detail. 344.52 - And yes, this is my actual outline. 346.58 - Now, the Outline method is great for creating well-organized notes, but because it\u2019s so rigid, 351.2 - you can easily end up with a ton of notes that all look the same. 353.98 - So to prevent that from happening, use formatting tricks to make important details stand out when you\u2019re reviewing them later on. 359.32 - For example: In these notes I took during an information systems class, you can see that I\u2019ve got several details written down underneath \u201cPrototyping\u201d. 365.74 - All of them were important enough to write down, but since the professor specifically 369.06 - mentioned that quick development and low cost were the most important aspects of prototyping, I made sure to bold that line. 374.84 - Next, we\u2019ll go over the Cornell Method. 376.94 - Developed by the Cornell University professor Walter Pauk back in the 1950\u2019s and popularized in his book How to Study in College, 383.04 - the Cornell method is a time-tested system that involves dividing your paper (or a table in your note-taking app) into three distinct sections: 389.42 - The Cue Column, The Notes Column, and The Summary Column. 393.12 - During a lecture, take your actual notes in the aptly-named Notes Column. 396.6 - Yeah \u2013 you\u2019ll learn that there\u2019s not a whole lot of misdirection when it comes to Study Skills. 400.04 - Anyway, here you can use any method you want, be it the standard outline method we just talked about or something more flexible. 405.46 - At the same time, when you think of questions that weren\u2019t answered \u2013 or that would be great prompts for later review \u2013 write them down in the Cue Column. 411.82 - These questions will come in handy when you\u2019re going through your notes in the future, as they\u2019ll point you to the most important information and help to frame your thinking. 417.99 - The Summary Area will remain empty until the lecture is over. 420.91 - Once that time comes, take two or three minutes to briefly look over the notes you took and 424.37 - the questions you wrote down, and then write a 1-2 sentence summary of the biggest ideas that were covered. 428.96 - This serves as an initial review, which helps to consolidate everything that was presented up here 433.36 - and to solidify your understanding while everything is still fresh in your mind. 436.66 - If neither of these two methods seems like the right fit for you, you might like the final method we\u2019re going to cover, which is Mind Mapping. 442.08 - Mind maps are diagrams that visually represent the relationships between individual concepts and facts. 447.52 - Like outline-style maps, they\u2019re very hierarchical \u2013 but that\u2019s where the similarities end. 451.6 - Outline-style notes are linear and read much like normal text, while mind maps look more like trees or spiderwebs. 456.74 - To create a mind map, you write the main concept smack-dab in the middle of the page, and then branch out from there to flesh out the details. 462.62 - This method works really well on paper, but there are also apps like Coggle which will let you create mind maps on your computer as well. 468.24 - So what\u2019s the best method? Well, that\u2019s up for you to decide. 471.5 - I recommend trying each one out, and making your own tweaks as you go along. 475.03 - Also, remember that not every class will work best with the exact same method. 479.2 - Your history notes are probably going to look pretty different from your math notes. 482.74 - So that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to wrap this video up. 484.88 - At this point, you should know how to come to class prepared to take good notes, what to focus on during the lecture, and what method to use. 490.49 - In a future video, we\u2019ll follow up on these points with some tips on how you can review those notes during your study sessions \u2013 495.69 - but for now, just go take some good notes! 498.0 - Thanks for watching, and I\u2019ll see you next time. 499.96 - Crash Course Study Skills is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C.

grumble at your alarm a little bit 12.13 - then get ready and go to class. 15.04 - But then we had to go and add computers into the mix. 19.26 - Online classes. 20.35 - These things have been growing in popularity for years, 22.8 - there are free ones, there are cheap ones, 24.78 - there are very expensive ones, 26.38 - talked to you by guys in their garages, 28.23 - and they're even full-blown university courses 30.74 - that you can take online, 31.97 - even if you don't go to that university. 34.26 - But this year, in 2020, they became the only option 37.18 - for most people going back to school. 38.97 - So, I thought it was high time that we make a video on them 41.75 - because while online classes can be very convenient 44.45 - in some ways, they can also trip you up 46.65 - and make your life more difficult in others. 49.16 - Hence, there are some things that I think you should know 51.38 - how to do so you can prepare to be as successful 53.91 - as possible in whatever online class you're going to. 57.37 - So, welcome to class, welcome to my set. 59.56 - I bet I bet none of your teachers on Zoom 61.44 - have a set like this, 62.82 - which honestly is okay because good education doesn't 65.59 - need overblown production values like this, unless, like me, 69.26 - you are a dancing monkey trying to also appease an algorithm 72.2 - that will inevitably one day morph into 74.1 - a universe-dominating superintelligence and vaporize us all. 77.1 - Anyway, today we're gonna share five tips 79.33 - for helping you prepare for and get 81.03 - the most out of online classes. 83.35 - I think this is gonna be helpful for anybody going back 85.41 - to school in a formal setting online, 87.53 - but this should also be helpful for anybody taking 89.4 - an online class independently. 91.35 - So, whichever camp you're in, let's get started. 94.13 - Tip number one is to treat these classes 96.06 - just like they are real, in-person classes. 98.99 - See, the problem with online classes is 100.343 - that they are usually taught asynchronously, 102.93 - the instructor, the teacher prepares material ahead of time 105.54 - and then you do it at a different time. 107.81 - Now this might be changing a bit this year, 109.72 - since a lot of schools are going to online only education, 112.34 - you might see a lot of classes taught 113.79 - through video conferencing apps like Zoom and Hangouts, 116.38 - but I still think it's likely you're gonna have 117.79 - a lot of asynchronous learning time. 119.67 - You're going to be given a lot 120.53 - of independent reading assignments, homework assignments, 123.11 - and you're going to have to do them on your own at home. 125.64 - And if you're taking an independent online class, 127.64 - like I currently am with Samurai Guitarists class 129.83 - on music theory, then everything is independent. 132.93 - And the problem with this asynchronous, independent 135.88 - and distance nature of online classes is 138.32 - that it becomes really easy to fall behind 140.24 - if you're not self-disciplined. 142.22 - In-person classes are in-person, 144.89 - and they happen on a schedule and that schedule makes 147.17 - it a lot easier to stay on top of your reading 149.46 - and all of your homework assignments. 150.85 - And in addition to that, it also gives your day 153.01 - a bit more structure as well. 154.7 - With online classes, a lot of that structure is lacking, 157.73 - and I know this from experience. 159.4 - Back when I was in college, I took one online class 161.65 - amongst all of my in-person classes, 163.45 - it was a food science and nutrition class. 165.64 - And I bet you can guess which class, 167.75 - out of everything I took, I fell behind in the most, 171.08 - and it was that one. 171.913 - So, do whatever you can to treat your online classes 174.84 - just like they're real classes, in terms of schedule, 177.47 - in terms of where you do them, in terms of everything. 180.15 - Now, maybe your teachers already have you covered, 181.89 - they're gonna make you set up a desk, 183.31 - they're gonna do all the classes on Zoom, 185.2 - but in case they aren't, do it for yourself. 188.18 - Number one, set up a dedicated workspace for yourself, 191.09 - wherever you live. 192.01 - I made a whole video about that, 193.04 - I'll have that link in the description below 194.43 - if you wanna check it out, 195.56 - Secondly, create recurring events on your calendar 198.45 - for all of your classes, 199.7 - and then at the beginning of each week, 201.38 - look ahead at what you've got on your calendar 203.73 - and then build a schedule for yourself, 205.84 - making plans for homework, for any other events 208.21 - in the gaps between those recurring classes. 210.66 - Lastly, it's a really smart idea to keep up your routines. 213.46 - So have a morning routine that helps you get ready 215.53 - for the day, but also build some momentum so 217.96 - you start your online learning feeling fresh. 220.54 - Tip number two is to get serious 222.64 - about your calendar and your to do list. 225.0 - That mainly means adding new events to your calendar 227.4 - and new tasks to your to do list the moment you get them. 230.94 - See, it is already hard enough to keep the jumble of events 233.73 - and tasks straight in your head during normal times, 236.5 - but when everything moves online, 238.34 - you lose one key component to 240.25 - what scientists call episodic memory formation, 243.19 - which is the process that your brain goes through 245.01 - to consolidate and encode new memories, 247.43 - and that is location. 249.04 - Location is a huge part of this process 251.3 - as your memories get inextricably tied 253.48 - to where you were when you experienced them. 255.9 - And that's why people often ask questions like, 258.21 - where were you when the Fire Nation attacked? 260.9 - Personally, I was sitting in front of the TV 262.41 - in my parents' living room, probably eating a Fruit Roll-Up. 265.28 - Anyway, we also know that two pieces of information 267.9 - in the brain get linked in a two-way relationship. 271.38 - For instance, I can ask you, what is Goku's power level? 274.43 - And you're probably going to tell me it's over 9,000, 277.41 - but I can also ask you, 278.51 - name me something that is over 9,000? 281.13 - And you're likely to say, \"Goku's power level\", 283.52 - and that's why \"Jeopardy\" works. 285.74 - And I would submit that this also applies 287.84 - to your recollection of what happens 289.42 - as you go through a day of classes. 291.29 - If you're used to going from classroom to classroom, 294.02 - then moving everything online means that you're now losing 296.81 - out on a whole bunch of unique location information 299.58 - that would have likely helped you recall events 301.93 - and due dates assigned to you, 303.66 - which means that it's now more important than ever 306.13 - that you're getting this data into a system, 308.6 - an external system, that you trust, 310.75 - and then at the end of the day, 311.93 - you can review that system to make sure 313.88 - nothing slips through the cracks. 315.7 - And side note about calendars, 317.44 - keep time zones in mind as well. 320.0 - Now, if you're in middle school or high school 321.49 - and your physical school building 322.69 - is just a few miles down the road, 324.39 - well then maybe this doesn't matter to you at all. 326.48 - But if you're a university student who's maybe 328.62 - out of state and for the first time ever, 330.84 - doing school at a different time zone 332.68 - from where your university and your teacher is, 334.63 - then you wanna make sure that you have 335.9 - the right time zones on your calendar, 337.9 - and with Google Calendar, and pretty much 339.51 - every other calendar software out there, 341.29 - you can actually choose the time zone 342.79 - of any event you're creating 344.01 - and then it'll automatically translate 345.54 - the time zone when you're looking at your full calendar. 348.13 - And if you're trying to schedule events with a study group 350.41 - or like a virtual project group, 351.98 - and you're trying to figure out when everyone can meet, 354.02 - you can also use tools like Doodle, 355.75 - which lets everyone input the times they're available 358.07 - and it'll automatically do 359.22 - the time zone translation for you. 361.48 - Tip number three, American three this time, grazie, 364.99 - is to get digitally organized. 367.47 - Now, maybe you think you're already perfectly organized, 370.13 - maybe you watched my previous video and you actually 372.16 - went out and got your KonMari certification 374.2 - and now you're a minimalism master, 376.53 - but we gotta talk about this because with in-person classes, 379.22 - there are often a lot of paper handouts creating 381.64 - an emphasis on physical organization, 384.16 - on the beautiful analog world with all of its vinyl disks. 387.31 - But when classes move online, we burn those vinyl disks 390.85 - and everything becomes organized digitally. 393.14 - So you have to learn how to flawlessly organize 395.29 - all of your handouts on your computer. 397.41 - So don't be that guy who saves everything to the desktop, 400.65 - creating a giant jumbled mess of files and EXEs, 403.67 - and game saves and whatever else, 405.46 - create a folder in your file management system 408.36 - for every class that you're taking, 409.97 - and then create a sub folder for any kind of project 412.33 - you have within those classes that has more 414.27 - than one file associated with it. 416.33 - Additionally, within your note taking system, 418.27 - you wanna have a notebook for each class. 420.72 - Whether you're writing out notes with a pen on paper 423.23 - or using a tablet and a stylist, 425.17 - or you're typing them into a computer, 426.61 - you wanna have a specific place where everything 429.08 - for each class gets organized and grouped together. 432.93 - And if you're a Notion user, like I am, 434.66 - then you may wanna check out the note taking template 436.67 - that I created and made a video on, 438.38 - which has two different levels of hierarchy 440.52 - so you can easily organize your notes. 442.36 - If you're curious about that, 443.193 - I will have a template link in the description down below, 445.46 - which you can duplicate and try out if you want. 448.3 - Tip number number four is actually 449.63 - my favorite tip in this video. 451.45 - Find a way to break up your day. 453.84 - One of the things I miss most from college 455.75 - were little gaps of time in between my classes. 458.27 - Because I went to college on this huge campus, 461.01 - it was like a 100 acres or something, 462.62 - and that meant that I would sometimes have 464.4 - to literally power walk or get on my skateboard 467.27 - in order to make it across campus, 469.07 - to make it in time for the next class. 471.3 - But those mad dashes across campus were actually 474.35 - a nice way to break up the day, 476.57 - and they made every class feel like 477.93 - its own little independent segment, 479.88 - and they also gave me a way to just kind of get outside 481.84 - and get a little bit of exercise. 483.27 - And I remember being kind of bummed 485.06 - when I got my first internship and realized 487.15 - that all of my work was done from one tiny little cubicle. 491.45 - So, sometimes I would find ways to just get away from 494.67 - that cubicle and break up my day a little bit 496.52 - by going for a 20 minute walk downtown, 498.84 - or sometimes literally just walking up 500.61 - and down flights of stairs in the office building. 502.81 - And if you're about to start a full suite of online classes, 505.77 - then the place where you're going to be doing it is probably 508.16 - not a whole lot different than that cubicle I had. 510.68 - So you should find a way to break up your day as well. 513.26 - This could be as simple as every once in a while, 515.38 - getting up from your desk, stretching a bit 517.37 - and going for a walk, moving around a bit, 519.58 - just getting a little bit of a change of scenery. 522.16 - If you have a decent amount of room in your home, 524.12 - you could also take this a bit further 525.81 - by maybe switching locations during the day, 528.39 - going from your desk to the kitchen table, back to the desk. 531.3 - But even if you're not working with a whole lot of space, 533.64 - just getting up and giving yourself some of these breaks 536.01 - will help to make your learning time not feel like 538.22 - this big, giant amorphous blob of time that never ends. 542.37 - Finally, tip five, get yourself a virtual study group. 545.91 - Potentially, one of the worst things about learning online 548.56 - is the isolation, at least the physical isolation. 551.75 - Instead of sitting in a classroom with 20 other students 554.18 - and a teacher, you're at home, alone. 557.967 - - [Furby] Oh Thomas, you're never really alone. 562.65 - - One way that you can mitigate this, 564.09 - at least somewhat, is to form a virtual study group. 567.61 - You can do this by asking a few of your classmates 569.51 - to meet up with you on Google Hangouts or Zoom, 571.66 - just a few times a week so you can study together 574.08 - or review assignments, or make fart jokes. 576.063 - And you can also do, what I like to call, work calls. 579.04 - I used to do these all the time back 580.55 - with some blogger friends who lived in different states. 582.74 - And essentially we would just hop on Skype, 584.56 - because these were the Dark Ages 586.18 - and that's kind of what we had, 587.49 - and we'd just get on a call where really nobody would talk, 591.18 - but we would each be on the line with the other person, 593.85 - knowing that they were getting their work done. 596.52 - And there was just something about being in this call with 599.56 - other productive people that felt a little bit like working 602.76 - at the same table together. 603.83 - So it was actually kind of a nice productivity hack. 606.09 - And if this is something that you wanna do, 607.63 - there's actually a site called Focusmate 609.21 - that is kind of tailor-made for this purpose. 611.69 - When you start a session, it pairs you up with somebody else 613.7 - who wants a little bit of companionship, 615.13 - and then you just kind of work in silence together. 618.22 - My friend, Ransom, who is the head writer at my site, 620.13 - College Info Geek, and who's written a couple 621.61 - of the scripts for this channel, swears by this tool 624.1 - and has been using it ever since the lockdown started. 626.26 - So you might find it helpful as well. 628.26 - Now, if you'd like to test out everything you've learned 630.31 - in this video and also improve your habits, 632.59 - which can help you study more effectively 634.03 - and be more successful in your classes, 635.92 - then you might wanna go take my habit building class 637.98 - over on Skillshare. 639.49 - This is a short one hour class 640.9 - that'll help you stick to your habits, 642.45 - even after the initial novelty period has worn off. 645.46 - And we do that in three different ways, 647.53 - European three this time. 648.78 - Number one, strengthening your internal self-discipline, 651.44 - number two, assisting that self-discipline with smart, 653.91 - external systems that help keep you on track, 656.05 - and number three, improving those habits over time 658.64 - with regular reflection. 660.28 - Over 40,000 people have already taken this class, 662.55 - and I think you're gonna get a ton out of it 664.17 - if you choose to take it as well. 665.99 - And if you wanna take it for free, you can actually do 668.27 - that by being one of the first 1,000 people 670.12 - to sign up for Skillshare, using the link in 671.82 - the description down below. 673.43 - Doing that will get you a two month free trial 675.32 - with unlimited access to the platform. 677.41 - So you can go take my class and you can also check out 679.47 - some of the thousands of other classes 680.86 - they have spanning productivity, business, analytics, 684.18 - marketing, video production, and lots, lots more. 687.67 - Plus after the trial ends, Skillshare is still 689.97 - way more affordable than most online learning platforms 692.44 - out there with plans starting at less than $10 a month. 695.65 - So once again, if you wanna take my class, 697.35 - be one of the first 1,000 people to sign up with 699.36 - that link in the description down below 700.65 - to get your two month free trial, 702.11 - and to also support my channel by supporting one 704.17 - of the awesome companies that sponsors me. 706.53 - Thanks so much for watching, as always, 708.12 - if you enjoyed this video, hitting that like button 710.06 - with your middle knuckle, very gently, 711.87 - tells the YouTube algorithm that you liked the video, 714.53 - and that is one of those pieces of data 716.06 - the algorithm uses to potentially share the video out 718.88 - to more people, which is hugely helpful for my channel, 721.41 - so thank you so much if you do that. 723.23 - But of course the biggest factor the algorithm looks at 725.82 - is just how long you watched the video, so seriously, 729.13 - thank you for sticking around to the end, 730.88 - and I'm really glad that you enjoyed what you're watching. 733.27 - If you haven't subscribed already, 734.38 - you can subscribe right there 735.51 -

on your phone screen to watch. 744.55 - But of course, if you don't wanna do any of that, 746.95 - then don't do that, don't clean your room 749.12 - and go eat an entire pint of ice cream if you want to, 751.75 - I'm probably gonna go do that because, as always, 754.16 - I'm not your dad."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction and Sponsor Message 0:19 - The Rise of Online Classes 0:57 -

And while you may have heard more about this 7.18 - recently, this trend isn't new. 9.36 - Between 2005 and 2015, the share just grew very steeply 13.61 - over this ten-year period. 14.87 - Since then, it's been fairly stable. 16.49 - There was an uptick, of course, during the pandemic. 19.24 - In the wake of the pandemic, those rates of parental 21.86 - co-residence are now about where they were right before. 24.67 - Part of the reason we see this escalation of young 27.02 - adults not leaving the nest or returning to the nest, is 29.65 - this idea that it was harder and harder for them to weather 32.58 - shocks? Nearly 30% of Gen Z said they would like to save but don't 36.71 - make enough money.

I saw all of the money that I was saving, and I thought 53.81 - maybe I should stay home for a little bit, and I didn't 56.68 - feel an urgency to move out. 58.09 - Not everyone is enthusiastic about this trend. 60.69 - You guys are making six figures together. 62.86 - You can't tell me you can't afford a house. 64.89 - They just don't want to spend their money. 67.07 - 36% of Americans said in a 2022 survey that more young 70.69 - adults living with their parents is bad for society. 73.25 - So here's why young Americans are choosing to live with 75.79 - their parents, and what the implications are for the U.S. 78.39 - economy.

Currently live at the Jersey 111.58 - Shore and I was commuting into 113.05 - New York City, which takes about two hours each way. 116.08 - And I thought, you know, in six months or so, I'll move 118.73 - into the city, be closer to the job. 120.49 - And the pandemic threw a wrench in those plans. 122.92 - Victoria now works a fully remote job, which she says she 126.04 - probably wouldn't have if it weren't for the pandemic. 128.6 - Without a commute to worry about, she was able to stay at 131.1 - her mom's for longer. It's a lot harder for young people today to save up for 136.1 - markers of the American Dream than it was for previous 138.9 - generations. Part of the reason we see this escalation 141.83 - of young adults not leaving the nest or returning to the 144.31 - nest, is this idea that it was harder and harder for them 147.12 - to weather shocks. 148.36 - So, for example, if they suffered a layoff or they 150.83 - suffered some sort of health shock, or they got in a car 153.08 - accident, if they didn't have any additional credit to 155.7 - weather that shock, they would end up moving back home. 158.46 - The financial stability of young adults, their ability to 161.86 - pay for things if they got into an emergency, was one of 164.6 - the big factors influencing whether or not they were 166.87 - living on their own or living with their parents. 169.15 - A significant number of Gen Z adults and millennials lack 172.21 - emergency savings. 173.57 - In fact, 46% of millennials and 32% of Gen Z have more 177.79 - credit card debt than emergency savings. 180.4 - This can have ramifications for setting up a financial 182.67 - future. Roughly 1 in 4 Gen Z adults say housing 191.67 - costs are one of the biggest challenges to financial 194.11 - success. The prices of homes has escalated over the last few 197.91 - decades much faster than actual incomes. 200.53 - So it is actually much harder for a millennial or a Gen Z to 204.68 - save up for a down payment to buy a home. 206.92 - And that's something that bears out in the data. 209.07 - The pandemic did have a lot to do with it. 210.79 - I saw how much I was saving and I was like, hmm, maybe I 213.49 - shouldn't be paying, you know, upwards of $3,000 a 216.16 - month and making somebody else richer when I could stay 221.66 - at home and save that money and spend it on where I want 225.01 - to spend it. Between my job and my bartending and 228.09 - waitressing, I make anywhere from 85 to $95,000 a year. 231.17 - I would say about 40 to 50% of my salary is going right 234.56 - into savings. My mentality is, why rent and give my money 238.09 - to someone else when I can start to own. 239.87 - So a big chunk of that money is going to go towards a down 242.31 - payment on a house. Young adults ages 25 to 34, in high cost of living areas, are 246.98 - more likely to live with their parents. 248.88 - Nearly 26% of young adults in new Jersey were living with at 252.13 - least one of their parents in 2022. 254.55 - The median household income in Oceanport, New Jersey, 257.18 - where the Franklins live, was nearly $133,000 in 2022, while 262.07 - the median value of a home in the region was around 264.95 - $644,000. 267.25 - My dad built this house for $350,000 and was making 273.06 - probably 10 to 15,000 less than I was. 275.11 - My mom wasn't working at the time, and they were able to 277.43 - afford a $350,000 house on a $70,000 a year salary with a 281.99 - son. And that is just that's not even the American dream 285.76 - anymore. That's not even possible. My aunt, who I fight 288.65 - with all the time, is always saying how you have to give 291.69 - somewhere, right? And my cousin said something to her 294.03 - the other day and said, we're giving everywhere. 296.36 - We don't get property, we don't get good school systems. 298.91 - Whatever we're trading off is too much to trade off. 302.47 - Victoria had brought up some conflict with her aunt a few 304.69 - times. Oh, this is my Aunt Judy. 310.1 - So I asked Aunt Judy to come on over and talk to us. 312.75 - I talked about how much we fight about millennials living 317.9 - at home and how you always say, well, you have to 321.36 - sacrifice something. 323.27 - But how much we're sacrificing. 326.8 - We don't get like a big property, or we don't get like 328.92 - a nice house or it's not in a good school system. 331.05 - You have to start somewhere. 332.39 - You have to start anywhere. 333.67 - Just start your portfolio, is what I told you. 336.23 - I don't care what it is. 337.27 - You don't have to live in Oceanport your first time. 340.04 - No, but you were able to live in Oceanport the first time. 342.21 - Okay, I guess it was different times. 343.7 - Gen X and Baby boomers may have a tougher time 346.81 - understanding what young adults are going through today 349.35 - because they enjoyed until the pandemic recession hit, 352.47 - you know, a solid almost 15 years of uninterrupted 356.21 - economic expansion. Baby boomers, Gen X, they weathered many economic 360.14 - downturns, including major recessions. 362.9 - But I think the big difference is that when they 365.47 - were starting to form their own households and starting to 368.4 - accumulate wealth, housing and higher ed were both more 371.86 - affordable relative to their incomes than they are now. 374.71 - When I started out, I was making $35,000 a year. 377.11 - That was nothing. And he was making $35,000 a year. 380.38 - You guys are making six figures together. 382.55 - You can't tell me you can't afford a house. 385.39 - You just don't want to spend their money. 388.15 - Told you. Is this what you wanted? 390.22 - What was my first house? 250, maybe 270? 393.8 - That doesn't exist anymore. 395.22 - Where am I finding a $270,000 house? 396.95 - I'm not making $35,000 a year. 398.91 - Combined, we made 70. 401.05 - In 1995. 402.24 - $70,000 was the equivalent of $145,000 today. 406.33 - Oh. Yeah, look at that. 409.09 - See? We do also have a situation that what is really good for 417.87 - an individual person or an individual family is not 420.85 - necessarily good for the entire macro economy. 423.33 - The Federal Reserve estimates in a 2019 paper that young 426.63 - adults who move out of their parents house would spend 429.11 - around $13,000 more per year on things such as housing, 433.35 - food and transportation. 435.08 - One of the big boosts to consumer spending is when 437.91 - people form households. 439.14 - Whether you're a renter or a buyer, you need to furnish 441.1 - that house. You need to fix things up in the home, to make 444.24 - it livable. You end up spending a lot of money during 446.53 - that time. So if the pace of household formation slows down 451.4 - and that's going to slow down the pace of consumer spending 454.01 - and that will produce a drag on the economy. 456.51 - Another issue is that there aren't enough affordable 458.8 - properties in popular areas for younger people who are in 461.81 - entry level jobs and making less money. 464.0 - any sort of housing policy needs to be 466.46 - multi-pronged. Are there homes that are at the price 468.9 - point of these prospective home buyers? 470.75 - What can we do to increase the housing supply? 473.0 - What can we do to build? 474.23 - What can we do to help elder Americans, to help them 477.58 - downsize and move into more right sized homes that will 480.64 - open up larger homes for for young families. 483.28 - So I think one alone is not really going to do it. 485.84 - We've got to look both at demand as well as supply. 487.99 - The other major factor here is how much student loan debt 490.68 - young Americans have. 59% of U.S. 493.43 - adults say they've delayed financial milestones because 495.99 - of their student debt. I do have a student loan payment. 498.75 - It's about $480 a 500.2 - month, so that's my largest expense. 502.49 - The liability could be worse for Black borrowers, who tend 505.39 - to have higher than average student loan debt and less 507.65 - wealth than white counterparts. 509.0 - Black and Hispanic respondents were more likely to say the debt 512.35 - was holding them back from reaching financial milestones. 515.01 - Less than half of white respondents said the same. 517.47 - The amount of debt young adults held also rose 519.88 - substantially between 2005 and 2014 \u2013 during that period 523.62 - of strong escalation in that cohort living with their 526.1 - parents. Aggregate student loans are such an enormous part of the 529.82 - economy now. And that's not a reflection of younger people 533.63 - making bad choices with their education. 536.06 - It's really a consequence, in large part due to the fact 539.77 - that there's less public funding, and going to college 542.52 - just is more expensive, which makes it even harder for even 545.56 - those college grads who are hopefully earning more money 547.93 - as a result of their college degrees. Student loan debt by 550.48 - itself can't explain the phenomenon, 552.26 - especially considering so many European countries with 554.68 - much less student loan debt have higher rates of young 557.41 - adults living with their parents. 24 out of 29 European 560.7 - countries had more 18 to 34 year olds living with their 563.39 - parents in 2021 than the U.S. 566.02 - It was over 70% in Italy, Portugal, Greece, Serbia and 569.71 - Croatia. My boyfriend is Brazilian, and 572.3 - multigenerational homes are 573.59 - very common in almost everywhere else in the world 576.66 - except in the United States. 577.86 - So I'm just taking a page of their playbook. 580.43 - The Americans are probably the only people that they're not 583.21 - multi generations in one house, and I don't have a 586.59 - problem with it. I mean, I think it's kind of nice. 588.8 - Why do we have to be so cold to push everybody out? 591.32 - You know there are a lot of cultures out there in which it 593.7 - is normal to live with your parents until you get married, 596.06 - and I don't think there's necessarily an economic 597.91 - explanation for that. 599.11 - The Franklins would say in the U.S. 600.63 - it is the economy, but Victoria's mom is kind of okay 603.52 - with it. Unfortunately, it is the economy and the world that we 607.33 - live in that just doesn't allow them to go live a 609.9 - comfortable life. So with them living here was no big 611.87 - deal. It's not really a problem. 613.9 - They're saving their money. Eventually they'll buy a house 616.51 - and that works."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Living with Parents in the U.S. 0:16 - Trends in Parental Co-Residence 1:00 - Financial Challenges for Young Adults 1:45 - Victoria\u2019s Story: Living with Family 3:00 - Economic Pressures and Savings Struggles 4:15 - Housing Costs and Generational Differences 5:30 - Family Perspectives on Multigenerational Living 6:15 - Broader Impacts on the U.S. Economy 7:15 - International Comparisons: Multigenerational Norms 8:00 - Conclusions: The Reality of Today's Economy "}]}

here's what I do as a data analyst I 2.639 - have over 10 years experience as a data 5.48 - analyst manager of data analytics and 7.799 - now as a business intelligence engineer 10.519 - and after all these experiences I want 13.4 - to give you a realistic picture of what 15.679 - a data analyst does so let's get started 18.039 - the first is what is a data analyst a 20.6 - data analyst is just someone that 22.96 - gathers data studies it and then makes a 26.0 - decision so think about when you're 27.76 - buying a car you're going to want to 30.199 - compare prices look at the different 32.879 - features decide whether it makes sense 35.44 - to lease a car versus buy it and after 38.84 - all that analysis you'll then go ahead 41.96 - and buy the car that's best for you so 44.44 - that's basically what a data analyst 46.399 - does they're going to assess all the 49.12 - data points and then make a decision 51.559 - based off of it and there's many 53.48 - different types of data analyst I know 55.6 - it's very confusing there's business 58.399 - analysts there's finan financial analyst 61.199 - Healthcare analyst they all 63.119 - fundamentally do the same data analysis 66.88 - but the biggest difference will be their 69.479 - domain so a financial analyst will be 72.68 - working on financial reports whereas a 75.479 - business analyst is going to be working 77.72 - closer with the business and business 80.4 - decisions and also some of the roles 82.799 - will be more technical than the other so 85.52 - what do I do as a data analyst my role 88.72 - is a mix of of business analyst data 92.399 - engineer and data analyst like a 95.32 - business analyst I work really closely 97.439 - with the business to determine what are 100.04 - the metrics that impact the business and 103.119 - like a data engineer I then work on 106.079 - ingesting the data building the various 108.56 - data pipelines and then like a data 110.96 - analyst I'll then analyze the data and 113.6 - presented so you can already tell 115.68 - there's a lot of overlap between all of 118.28 - these data roles when you you say data 120.759 - analyst versus data engineer versus data 123.719 - scientist and if you want a video 126.28 - specifically on what the differences 128.599 - between all of these let me know in the 130.36 - comments and I'd be happy to do it what 132.44 - is the workflow of a data analyst a data 135.28 - analyst works on the problem then the 138.68 - data and then reporting starting with 141.56 - the problem the problem statement is 143.68 - like a blueprint for a data analyst it 146.599 - really tells them what direction they 148.56 - need to go in as as well as what is it 151.2 - that they need to solve for so with the 153.64 - problem statement of what is the best 156.16 - car to buy versus what is the most 159.0 - affordable car to buy you would be 161.36 - looking at two different data sets 164.239 - because the problem of what is the best 167.4 - car to buy would require looking at 169.48 - safety ratings versus the most 172.04 - affordable car you would solely be 174.08 - looking at prices and in a workplace 176.4 - setting you're going to have 178.04 - stakeholders which are basically 179.72 - basically just people in your 181.8 - organization who will have business 184.36 - problems and want you to solve them with 187.12 - data and I document all of that down in 189.959 - a design document outlining the problem 193.44 - what the solution will be including the 195.56 - impact and then I include the metrics 198.12 - that we're going to use in the solution 199.92 - as well and make sure that we are all 201.879 - aligned before I work on the data data 204.159 - is not always readily available and 206.56 - you'll find that in the real world you 208.599 - spend a lot of the time looking for data 211.319 - now once you find it you then have to 213.08 - figure out how to ingest it on a regular 216.159 - basis and then you work on the actual 218.28 - analysis part of the data once the data 220.92 - is prepared then you'll do the 222.879 - presentation part which is reporting 225.239 - it'll either be through a visualization 227.92 - in a bi tool sometimes it's a simple 230.439 - Excel report other times it's a data 233.519 - solution in this process you want to 235.879 - make sure that you're using your 237.439 - communication skills getting feed 239.64 - feedback and also documenting everything 242.079 - so that if someone asked you a few 243.76 - months later what this report was you 245.64 - have everything documented what does a 247.84 - data analyst team look like well it can 250.68 - either be a team of one or a team of 10 253.92 - there really is no standard here you may 256.32 - find a role where you're the only data 258.44 - analyst and I've been there but I didn't 261.359 - really like it because I felt that I 263.639 - didn't have anyone to bounce ideas off 266.12 - with and no one to learn from whereas 269.08 - now I'm on a team of data Engineers as 273.12 - well as partner software engineers and 275.8 - just being surrounded by a team helps me 278.72 - learn a lot so I prefer having a larger 281.28 - team and if you're debating and you even 283.12 - have a chance to decide I would 284.88 - recommend going with a bigger team what 287.0 - is the realistic life of a data analyst 289.84 - I feel like the data analyst life has 291.84 - really been glamorized on social media 294.6 - it's the trend of people working from 296.56 - home making six figures working in Tech 299.8 - it's really good but there are just some 302.479 - realistic downsides that you should be 304.8 - aware of such as working with 307.28 - stakeholders who will have unrealistic 310.4 - expectations of work from you at the end 313.36 - of the day I get a ping from someone who 316.199 - says hey can you work on this report and 318.96 - get it done by end of day and I'm 321.24 - thinking it already is end of day then 324.12 - it puts you in a spot of having to work 326.639 - late and then when you ask those 328.319 - clarifying questions of hey what exactly 330.84 - is it that you need they don't even know 333.199 - and being honest there actually have 335.039 - been times where I've had to log in at 337.68 - 900 p.m. even because last minute I get 341.16 - a request saying hey can you pull this 343.4 - report and so having to manage the 346.6 - unrealistic idea that you can pull 349.68 - reports quickly and deliver it happens a 352.12 - lot and you should just be aware of how 354.44 - to manage your stakeholders and it's not 356.8 - only last minute deliverables but you'll 359.199 - get a lot of side chats from people 361.919 - pinging you all day they'll have 364.479 - questions like hey why isn't this 367.039 - dashboard working or hey can you look 370.08 - into this one problem I have honestly 372.759 - responding to all those reports take up 376.24 - your whole day and before you know it by 379.199 - 5:00 you got nothing done knowing all 381.919 - this why am I a data analyst well there 384.199 - are two reasons the first is work life 386.8 - balance so that part is true I have to 388.88 - say as a DayDay analyst I do have a lot 391.479 - of time to myself and I think that's 393.8 - really important because previously I 396.599 - was working as a consultant working 398.84 - 50-hour weeks and by the time you're 401.12 - done with work and commute honestly I 403.199 - had no time to myself and that's what 405.72 - made me realize that it's important to 408.919 - have a good career but also equally 411.08 - important to have a good life outside of 413.52 - your career and so being a data analyst 416.08 - does allow me to confidently make plans 418.919 - with my friends friends at 5:00 or have 422.0 - enough time to work on my side passions 425.16 - like YouTube and if you are enjoying 427.479 - this video please like And subscribe as 430.199 - it helps me a lot and just having the 432.72 - ability to have time to myself is really 435.639 - the deal breaker for me and second is 438.68 - the pay so a data analyst pay is very 442.16 - competitive I'll be honest especially 444.479 - working in Tech the salary is closer to 447.56 - 150,000 250 ,000 and if you're 450.759 - interested more in the salary and want a 452.479 - whole video on that let me know in the 454.199 - comments because I can do that as well 456.12 - so should you be a data analyst honestly 459.039 - anyone can be a data analyst and 461.759 - learning technical skills is something 464.159 - that anyone can do but what I feel like 467.039 - is overlooked a lot is people don't talk 469.8 - about the soft skills that also are 473.039 - really important in addition to the 475.68 - technical skills and yes the technical 478.639 - skills will get you your first job and 482.24 - put your foot in the door but once 484.599 - you're there I think what I learned from 487.319 - all my experience is that those soft 490.039 - skills of being able to communicate 492.599 - influence others make connections with 495.44 - other teams is really what will get you 497.8 - promoted will get you a better job those 501.639 - are skills that I think are equally as 504.12 - important and so if you're thinking 506.12 - about a data analyst career think about 509.319 - all the things I said and see if that is 511.96 - something you realistically see yourself 514.36 - doing still want to be a data analyst 517.0 - watch my next video on how I'd become a 519.56 - data analyst if I had to start over 522.08 - thanks and I'll see you on that video"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

first we will use Chat GPT to create prompts 46.766 - to generate images for the video 48.7 - so I will access chat GPT 50.566 - and request to execute some commands as follows 53.4 - please pay attention 54.6 - here are some commands I will ask chat GPT to perform 64.333 - for example here I have a sample prompt 66.133 - generate image as a reference 80.766 - from the sample prompt as reference above 82.9 - I will ask Chat GPT to create other new prompts 86.033 - many of you watch my tutorial videos 88.1 - and ask me for all the prompts 90.266 - but everything is done by Chat GPT 92.933 - my purpose is to guide you on how to train Chat GPT 95.866 - effectively 96.7 - so watch the video carefully and practice step by step 99.766 - as I instruct you will have much better skills 102.533 - instead of simply copying 100% of the original 142.966 - so here are the prompt 144.1 - generate image results that Chat GPT created for us 147.5 - next step I will use these prompts to generate images 150.233 - for the video with another AI platform 157.333 - for example here I will choose any prompt 164.633 - next I will use an AI platform called Jain AI 167.433 - I have made many tutorial videos about this platform 170.433 - and have full instructions on how to create an account 173.033 - and how to use it you can review the previous video 176.433 -

Adam here. 1.17 - And in this video, 2.01 - I'm gonna help you become a better digital marketer 4.5 - by showing you some of the most important things 6.48 - you need to know about digital marketing right now. 8.88 - You see, digital marketing has been made 10.59 - to seem way more complicated than it actually is. 13.56 - That's a shame really 14.55 - because it's actually pretty straightforward. 16.32 - That said, if you do want to get the best results possible 19.53 - from your digital marketing, 21.15 - you're going to need to know and understand the strategies 23.76 - that I'm gonna be sharing with you in this episode. 25.95 - So, my promise to you is this. 27.39 - If you watch this entire video, 29.07 - you will be a better digital marketer at the end. 32.01 - So, let's get to it. 33.05 - (bright upbeat music) 37.32 - So, the very first thing that I need to share with you 39.6 - are the differences between digital marketing 41.7 - and traditional marketing. 43.68 - Brace yourself for this one 'cause it's pretty profound. 46.02 - Actually, it's not profound at all. 47.67 - And that's what makes it so interesting. 49.11 - You see, digital marketing is really just marketing 52.5 - done through the use of digital channels. 55.14 - That's it. 55.973 - So, when we're talking about digital marketing, 57.93 - well, we're talking about marketing 59.34 - through the use of channels like SEO 61.47 - or Search Engine Optimization, 63.27 - social media, pay per click ads or online Facebook ads, 66.87 - Instagram ads, or anything like that. 68.46 - Not to mention email marketing or website optimization, 72.0 - or anything that really takes place online 74.94 - or through the use of digital media. 76.53 - You can contrast this with traditional marketing 79.35 - using traditional media. 80.58 - Things like TV or the radio or newspapers, 84.27 - or magazines or billboards. 85.83 - Basically, anything not digital. 87.9 - Now here's the deal, 89.07 - traditional marketing and traditional advertising 91.65 - and everything that goes into it, well, it still works, 94.41 - but there are some significant advantages 96.6 - to using digital marketing and all the digital channels 99.69 - that we now have available. 101.01 - First of all, digital marketing tends to give you 102.93 - a much larger audience size. 104.91 - Really, you can reach anybody that's online 106.98 - and there's billions and billions of people online. 109.5 - Next is audience targeting 111.06 - because not only are you able to reach 112.86 - these billions of people. 114.09 - Well, you don't wanna reach all of them because all of them 116.58 - are not going to be the perfect fit for your business. 118.83 - Rather, you can be laser-focused and selective 121.26 - on only the most ideal and perfect people 123.93 - that you wanna target. 124.98 - Digital marketing also tends to be significantly 127.14 - more cost effective than running say, 129.36 - an ad in the New York Times 130.89 - or heaven forbid, a Super Bowl commercial. 133.38 - Again, these are designed to appeal to mass markets 136.26 - and to try to reach everyone. 137.85 - Probably not your goal. 139.35 - Rather what you wanna do is be laser focused and selective 142.41 - with your marketing and reach again 143.88 - only those people most likely to buy. 145.59 - Digital marketing also allows you to get immediate feedback. 148.32 - And this is probably one of my favorite benefits 150.57 - of the channels. 151.65 - After all, if you think about running, 153.12 - say a magazine ad where you've got to think of the copy 155.652 - and the creative and what you're going to say, 157.65 - and then you've gotta get it all written up 159.45 - and sent to the magazine. 160.71 - It's gotta get published and then distributed. 163.05 - Well, you could be looking at weeks at best, 165.63 - months and maybe many, many months 168.0 - before you ever figure out if this worked or not. 170.4 - Digital marketing on the other hand. 171.93 - Well, in theory, you can write an ad 174.18 - and have it online in a matter of minutes. 176.43 - Immediate feedback, immediate correction, immediate results. 179.61 - Plus, digital marketing tends to be a whole lot easier 182.1 - to measure and to track because everything's digital 185.25 - which means we've got a digital trail allowing us to measure 189.03 - costs and results and everything in real time 192.54 - so we can make adjustments and tweaks 194.46 - and optimizations on the fly. 195.78 - Again, contrast that with waiting three months 198.57 - for your magazine to come out 199.62 - and figure out if things worked or not. 201.39 - And you can't measure clicks on a magazine. 203.04 - So, the best you can hope to do 204.36 - is well, really, either have them fill out 206.37 - some kind of a form on the magazine 207.78 - or visit a digital channel 209.64 - which ties us back into digital marketing. 211.65 - Anyway, there's obviously some serious advantages here 214.23 - to choosing digital channels going with digital marketing. 217.11 - But again, that's not to say that traditional marketing 219.63 - doesn't still work. 220.89 - It does. 221.723 - The point here is to take a look at either traditional 224.31 - or digital marketing and then sort of take a few steps back 228.0 - to the strategies and the fundamentals and the principles, 231.24 - the consumer psychology, the buyer behavior, 234.0 - why people do the things they do 235.83 - and then focus on mastering and learning that. 238.17 - Then, you can apply that to digital channels 240.51 - or traditional channels or any other channels 242.49 - that come out in the future. 243.66 - All right, the next thing that'll really help you 245.46 - become a better digital marketer is to understand 248.07 - the differences between strategy and tactics 251.01 - and when to use them. 251.843 - Strategy is all the big picture stuff. 254.25 - And this is really where you wanna focus your efforts. 256.32 - First and foremost, because this is the foundation 258.741 - that all of your future marketing efforts and tactics 261.78 - and tools and software and things like that 263.79 - are gonna be built on. 264.63 - Get this part wrong and nothing else matters 267.0 - because nothing else will work. 268.62 - Now, there are a ton of different strategies and approaches 272.1 - and ways to look at your digital marketing, 274.53 - but pretty much no matter how you look at it, 276.81 - it always comes back to four basic 278.97 - and really solid principles 280.74 - that have stood the test of time 281.97 - and are gonna be just as relevant today 283.77 - as they are a hundred years from now. 285.27 - I call these things the core four 287.13 - and they make up the center 288.66 - of my \"Hub & Spoke\" model of marketing. 290.79 - The core four are made up of model, market, 293.46 - message and media. 294.84 - So, let's unpack those now. 295.98 - The model is essentially your business. 298.2 - Your offer, your package, your servicing, 300.51 - the pricing that goes with it, 302.01 - how you deliver whatever it is 303.45 - that you deliver to the market. 304.74 - It's important here to design your model, 307.05 - design your business around what is the most enjoyable 310.29 - and profitable and in demand by the market. 313.17 - 'Cause the worst thing you can do is build a business 315.54 - that you absolutely hate. 316.77 - Next is the market. 318.09 - These are the people that you're going to serve 320.1 - and you don't wanna say everyone or anyone with money. 323.22 - You wanna be focused, laser focused 325.41 - on exactly who is going to get the best results 327.81 - from your product or service. 329.19 - And also the market that you're going to most enjoy serving. 332.37 - In marketing, we call this an ideal customer avatar 335.01 - or an ideal client avatar. 336.199 - And it's made up of demographic details 338.7 - like age, gender, income, occupation. 341.4 - Geographic details like what city or state 343.8 - or province or country they live in. 345.27 - And psychographic details like what are their values, 347.94 - their attitudes and their lifestyles. 349.95 - Next is your message. 351.33 - And here's where you're going to clarify 353.61 - and connect with your ideal target market 356.43 - by speaking directly to them about their pains 359.01 - and their problems and their frustrations, 360.75 - and how your business is uniquely positioned 363.39 - to help solve that for them. 364.59 - Telling stories about previous customers 366.84 - and previous client results 368.04 - is an incredibly effective way to do this 369.81 - as are getting testimonials directly from them 372.33 - and running case studies 373.47 - proving that you know what you're talking about 375.48 - and have done what you say you're going to do. 377.76 - I think that made sense. 378.6 - The point here is that to craft truly effective messages, 381.93 - well, you've gotta understand who your market is 384.27 - and what really makes them up 386.1 - and what makes them do the things they do. 388.05 - So, a little bit of market research 389.4 - and having a few chats with your customers never hurts. 392.1 - And the fourth part of the core four, and again the center 395.1 - of that \"Hub & Spoke\" model of marketing 396.96 - is all about media. 398.25 - And this is where you're going to go, 399.93 - where you're going to do your marketing, 402.24 - which digital channels you're gonna choose. 404.34 - Most businesses do this completely backwards. 406.59 - They start with the media by hearing a great thing 408.99 - about Facebook ads or YouTube marketing. 411.69 - Maybe starting a podcast. 412.89 - And then they just rush in there, 414.54 - forgetting all about the message 416.49 - and the market and the model. 418.08 - So, unsurprisingly, well they're building their business 420.69 - and they're building their marketing 421.83 - on a pretty sketchy foundation. 423.57 - This is why if you go through the steps in the right order, 426.18 - starting with the model, moving onto the market, 428.19 - identifying the message. 429.36 - By the time you get to media, 431.07 - the choices should be evidently clear. 433.41 - Like, crystal clear. 434.49 - You should know exactly where your ideal target market 437.46 - is present and active online. 439.44 - And this is going enable you to go there 441.39 - and ignore everything else. 442.74 - The reality is you don't need to do everything. 445.02 - You don't need to be everywhere. 446.58 - You just need to be the places 448.26 - where your ideal target market are present and active. 450.81 - This is gonna save you a ton of time and money and headache, 453.63 - and wasted energy by spreading yourself too thin 456.18 - on channels that simply aren't gonna deliver results. 458.49 - All right, so that was the strategy. 460.68 - The core four, the high level stuff 462.93 - that goes into making the right decisions. 465.27 - Tactics on the other hand are how you're going to execute 468.281 - everything I've just talked about. 469.92 - The tactics are the details and the actionable steps 473.37 - or executable things that you're actually going to go 476.37 - and put into practice. 477.57 - So, the strategy being the business model you're using, 480.33 - the market that you're going to go after, 482.01 - the messages you're going to use and the media choices 484.41 - that you're going to deploy your marketing on. 486.48 - And then the tactics being things 488.13 - like what frequency are you gonna post? 490.14 - And what kind of content are you gonna post? 493.14 - And what schedule or level of consistency 496.175 - or how many memes are you gonna throw in? 498.78 - A tactical question would be 500.58 - what's the best time to post on social media? 503.61 - A strategic question would be 505.44 - which social media platform should we be on? 507.6 - That's the difference. 508.53 - All right, the next thing that you need to know 510.54 - about digital marketing is the difference 512.31 - between organic and paid. 514.11 - So, let's start with organic. 515.64 - Organic content and organic digital marketing 518.4 - is essentially anything that you create for free. 521.31 - So, anytime that you make a post on Facebook 523.89 - or an Instagram story or a YouTube video, 526.836 - or anything like that and you're not paying money 529.98 - to have it promoted, you're creating organic content. 532.8 - Now, this doesn't mean that it's free content 534.99 - because odds are good, you put time and energy, 537.84 - and probably a decent amount of money 539.79 - behind the content that you're creating. 541.77 - But by not paying to promote it, 544.32 - it's still classified as organic content. 546.12 - So, if organic marketing is putting out content 548.61 - and not paying to have it promoted. 550.5 - Well then, paid marketing is the opposite of that. 553.62 - Putting out content and then paying the networks 555.893 - to promote it and distribute it to even more people. 558.72 - Basically, with paid media or paid marketing, paid ads, 562.68 - you're running advertising to whatever message 564.81 - or whatever content that you're putting out there. 566.43 - Now, the big players in this space right now 568.68 - are obviously the kingpins like Facebook ads, 571.86 - Instagram ads, and YouTube ads, 573.956 - LinkedIn ads and Google ads. 575.996 - Essentially, the major networks with ads 578.73 - added to the back of their name. 579.87 - Organic content shows up in the news feeds 582.18 - of people that follow you. 583.59 - Whereas with paid marketing and paid media, 585.93 - it shows up in the news feeds 587.34 - and on the phones and on the devices of the people 589.98 - that you choose through targeting. 591.72 - Now of course like all marketing strategies, 593.82 - there's pros and cons to both. 595.26 - Organic is free essentially in nature, 597.84 - but it's going to be a little more limited in reach 600.36 - because the way the algorithms work 601.92 - is they kind of favor paid media 603.84 - 'cause they like to make money. 604.89 - Paid media on the other hand 606.18 - has the obvious downside of costing money. 608.61 - Well, bright side, it allows you 609.72 - to reach a ton of people very quickly. 611.91 - So, essentially the choice between organic and paid 614.31 - comes down to time versus money 616.47 - but also the rate at which you want to experience results. 619.26 - All right, now let's talk about one of my favorite topics 621.63 - in all of marketing, direct response versus brand awareness. 625.2 - Direct response marketing is unsurprisingly direct 628.5 - in its goal to get a response. 630.54 - Man, marketing sure isn't very creative sometimes. 632.88 - Basically, when you do direct response marketing, 635.34 - you're creating an ad or you're creating a piece of content 638.37 - and you are focused on getting an immediate 640.92 - and tangible return, something like a lead or a sale, 645.12 - or a phone call, or a visit 647.25 - or a sign up or something like that. 649.08 - Direct response marketing would be run a Facebook ad, 652.02 - expect to generate a lead, send out an email, 654.235 - measure the number of conversions, promote a video, 656.94 - track how many people signed up for a free trial. 659.07 - All of these are direct response 660.57 - because you're expecting something ideally immediately 663.36 - and you're gonna be able to track and measure it. 665.1 - So, you can do more of what works and less of what doesn't. 667.32 - Now, contrast all of that with brand awareness marketing 669.889 - which is essentially more focused on longer term 672.619 - and building trust and authority 674.97 - and your brand name in the market. 676.26 - With direct response, we're measuring things 678.21 - like leads and sales and conversions. 680.67 - With brand awareness, we're measuring things 683.16 - like trust and authority, and possibly mentions, 687.36 - but a lot harder to quantify and to measure 690.63 - because they're a lot more intangible. 692.22 - The reality is long term to build a scalable 695.46 - and sustainable and profitable business, 697.74 - well, you do need a pretty decent mix 699.75 - of both direct response marketing 701.43 - and brand awareness marketing. 703.23 - But you have to be wary of the cardinal sin of marketing. 706.65 - You see, one of the biggest mistakes in all of marketing 709.29 - is running brand awareness marketing campaigns 711.84 - and expecting direct response results. 714.57 - This is a recipe for failure and one of the biggest reasons 717.51 - that many people claim their marketing just isn't working. 720.54 - It's because they're using the wrong tool for the job. 723.15 - Like following a recipe to bake a cake 725.4 - and then getting really frustrated 726.63 - when it comes out like muffins or bread 728.91 - or anything that isn't cake. 730.62 - This is why it's incredibly important 732.15 - that you use the right recipe or strategy for the job. 734.94 - I'll write another incredibly important thing 736.92 - you need to know about digital marketing 738.87 - is the difference between search and discovery marketing. 741.84 - When it comes to search versus discovery marketing, 744.45 - the biggest and most important 746.1 - or keyword, if you will, is intent. 748.71 - Basically, what's the intent or what is the reason 752.19 - that someone's using a specific platform 754.77 - when they log on in the morning or at noon, or at night? 757.86 - So, let's start with search. 759.51 - And here we're talking about platforms 761.16 - like Google and YouTube. 762.85 - Basically, any other search engine. 764.88 - When someone logs onto Google, for example, 767.04 - well, they have intent. 768.54 - They're there to find an answer or a solution or a product. 772.5 - They're there to do something or buy something 774.87 - or learn something or take some kind of action. 777.15 - This is where you as a marketer 778.8 - want to show up in front of them 780.63 - and basically answer their question 782.31 - or give them the solution to whatever it is 784.29 - that they're looking for. 785.123 - Some strategies here are using SEO 787.68 - or Search Engine Optimization, 789.27 - as well as Google ads which is pay per click advertising. 792.21 - Discovery marketing on the other hand, 794.01 - well, this encompasses brands like Facebook and Instagram 797.94 - and YouTube to a certain extent. 799.44 - Essentially, a user on these platforms may have intent 803.01 - but they're probably more casually browsing. 805.47 - After all, nobody really shows up in the morning, 807.42 - logs onto Facebook or Instagram with a credit card in hand 810.3 - looking to buy something. 811.29 - This is why if you're doing search marketing, 813.21 - well you can afford to be direct. 814.83 - They're looking for something? 816.24 - You have the answer. 817.17 - So you can just give it to them. 818.07 - With discovery marketing on the other hand, 819.78 - you've gotta be a little more creative 821.46 - and a little more entertaining. 822.99 - You've gotta get their attention and then keep it, 825.119 - and allow them to become interested 827.25 - in what it is that you're selling or promoting. 829.41 - Now, both search marketing and discovery marketing 831.87 - are incredibly important parts to building 834.27 - an overall successful and sustainable business. 837.12 - But just like with direct response marketing 839.7 - and brand awareness marketing, 841.115 - you wanna make sure that you're using the right tool 843.63 - for the right job at the right time in the right place. 846.78 - All right, next I've got something 848.25 - very important to share with you. 849.6 - And it's something that rarely gets talked 851.31 - about when it comes to marketing advice. 853.53 - And that is the difference between marketing products 855.96 - and marketing services. 857.34 - Here's the deal. 858.24 - Most of the marketing information out there 860.1 - whether we're talking about textbooks 862.08 - or courses, or even trainings, 864.78 - they revolve around the marketing of products. 867.0 - A product being something tangible that you can hold, 870.06 - that you can see, that you can touch and that you can taste. 873.57 - A service on the other hand is intangible. 876.39 - You can't hold it. 877.223 - You can't touch it. 878.056 - You can't see it. 879.12 - You can't taste it. 879.953 - Plus, with services you often need to pay in advance 882.54 - which requires a whole new level of trust. 884.91 - This is why if you're marketing a service-based business 887.61 - and you try to market it like a product-based business, 890.22 - well, you're gonna be very disappointed. 892.08 - Now, when it comes to marketing products, 893.91 - you have the opportunity and the advantage 895.92 - of being able to explain and to show and to demonstrate 899.16 - how a product works, what it looks like. 901.05 - You wanna show it in action. 902.31 - Show the features, show the benefits 904.26 - that the features will deliver. 905.94 - Show the story behind it. 907.38 - Everything like that. 908.213 - Here's an example. 909.18 - Let's say that I'm trying to promote and sell this pen. 912.0 - Well, the fact that this pen has a lid is a feature. 915.387 - The fact that it will prevent me 917.52 - from getting ink all over myself, that's a benefit. 919.77 - but you can take it further and you probably should. 922.32 - For example, this pen lid also has a clip which means 925.56 - that I can attach it to my papers or my notebook, 928.62 - or even my clothes if I'm trying to sport that nerdy look. 931.74 - Another feature of the pen lid itself 934.08 - is the fact that the lid has holes in the top. 936.69 - Maybe surprised to hear that the reason that pen lids 938.79 - have holes in the top is to prevent suffocation 941.34 - in case they accidentally or purposely get swallowed. 944.43 - After all chewing on pen lids is an age old 946.8 - albeit highly unsanitary practice. 949.14 - Sometimes you just get hungry. 950.37 - Services on the other hand, 951.6 - well, they don't have that advantage. 953.34 - So, the main thing when you're promoting 955.02 - and marketing services is you want to sell the end. 958.08 - Essentially, the end state or the benefits, or the outcome 961.35 - or the results that someone will experience 963.662 - after working with you. 965.04 - In fact, when it comes to marketing services, 967.35 - I'd go so far as to say it's pretty much 969.06 - all about the end state and the benefits 971.49 - and the outcomes and the results someone will experience. 973.71 - The key here is to highlight the current pain 976.23 - or dissatisfaction or discomfort of their current state. 979.92 - And then of course, paint the picture 981.72 - of how they'll be so much better 983.28 - after having worked with you. 984.3 - All right, the next thing you really need to be aware of 986.76 - if you want to become a true expert in digital marketing 989.46 - is to understand the differences 990.96 - between B2B and B2C marketing. 993.27 - B2B stands for business to business. 995.52 - And this is where your main customers, 997.47 - your main clients aren't regular everyday people, 1000.05 - but rather other businesses. 1001.73 - B2C on the other hand means you are a business 1004.19 - that sells to consumers. 1005.66 - Regular, everyday people and not businesses. 1008.24 - B2B, business to business. 1009.68 - B2C, business to consumer. 1011.24 - And just like everything I've shared with you so far, 1013.34 - there's some significant differences 1015.11 - in the way that you wanna market your business, 1016.88 - market your service, market your product, market whatever 1019.79 - depending on whether you're selling to businesses or people. 1022.58 - And this is why the next thing you're gonna wanna do 1024.68 - is check out the video I have linked up right here 1026.78 - on B2B versus B2C marketing. 1029.03 - So, make sure to check that out now 1030.92 - and I'll see you in the next episode. 1032.15 - Basically, B2B marketing typically focuses 1034.37 - on fewer but larger customers 1035.477 - and B2C marketing on more but smaller customers. 1038.87 - This means for B2B type marketing, 1040.55 - you're gonna have a little more incentive 1042.2 - to put a little more punch behind your pitch 1044.09 - because you're gonna have to market to fewer customers. 1046.507 -

62.35 - But still, I was making like a solid $2,000 a month. 66.18 - I was officially a business man. 68.865 - So I decided to hire a search engine optimization company because this is what we do! 74.239 - And that was the turning point for me when my fire for SEO was ignited. 78.4 - They scammed me for everything I had. 80.57 - The good thing that came out of that though was that it fueled me with rage so much so 85.409 - that I committed to focus on learning just SEO and to get really good at it so I wouldn't 91.21 - have to hire another company. 92.667 - And by around 2011, my company was worth over 7 figures and the main reason is because of SEO. 99.333 - Now, by definition, digital marketing is just marketing that happens over the internet. 103.549 - So you can choose to focus on just email marketing, pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, 109.232 - social media marketing, etc. 111.593 - Digital marketing is just so vast that it's impossible to become a master of all areas. 117.171 - It's best to focus on just one area of internet marketing and to get really good at it. 122.829 - Now, after you've chosen the area of digital marketing you want to focus on, you need to 126.925 - make a mental commitment to learn as much as possible. 130.35 - Now, while there isn't a single \"right\" way to learn digital marketing, what I've found 135.03 - to be helpful is to learn in 3 stages. 137.621 - So, for illustration purposes, let's say you chose SEO as your focus area. 142.23 - Now, stage one is to focus on understanding the fundamentals. 145.931 - So in SEO, that would include things like why and how SEO is important for businesses, 151.51 - how search engines work, and the main ways SEO is done \u2013 so that includes keyword research, 157.021 - link building, technical SEO and on-page SEO to name a few. 161.236 - Fundamentals may not be exciting, but they're absolutely critical to learning, whether you're 166.681 - learning an instrument, a new recipe, or digital marketing skills. 171.521 - Stage two is all about making connections in how the fundamentals work together. 175.931 - For example, you should be able to make the connection in SEO that content creation 180.792 - is reliant on keyword research and that on-page SEO is connected with both your content writing 186.48 - and keyword research. 188.209 - Finally, stage three is all about learning how these techniques are executed \u2013 more specifically, 194.43 - you'll want to get an idea of workflows and tools that you'll need to do your job. 199.069 - For example, you should at least know that keyword research is done with a tool like 202.918 - Keywords Explorer. 204.134 - And the way people find keyword ideas is by starting with a broad seed, going to a keyword 209.45 - ideas report, narrowing in on keywords with a set of filters, and then analyzing the search 215.167 - engine results pages to understand if it's possible to compete. 219.64 - These three stages are typically how courses are taught. 222.672 - And for that reason, I think it's worth taking a reputable beginner's course on the area 227.082 - of digital marketing you've chosen \u2013 like our free SEO fundamentals course. 231.495 - This is something that I was too young and arrogant to do when I was getting started 235.897 - with online marketing. 237.0 - I went with the unguided route and literally\u2026 anytime someone said \"advanced\", I was like 242.086 - Pavlov's dog and I'd give them all my attention. 245.173 - I wasted tons of time and money because for some reason, I subconsciously thought it would 250.196 - be more rewarding to figure it out on my own. 252.74 - Now, as you go through this learning stage and consume content, there's going to be  256.847 - a time when you feel like, \"yeah, this all makes sense!\" 260.085 - But I can guarantee you that when you actually get to doing it, it's not going to 264.951 - feel so straightforward anymore. 266.633 - And that's why the next thing I recommend is to commit to actually practicing what you've learned. 272.578 - In my opinion, there's no better way to learn digital marketing than to get first-hand experience. 277.607 - And the best way to do that is to create your own site. 280.721 - This way, you'll have a safe place to practice whatever and however you want. 285.217 - Now, as you commit to actually doing something, I highly recommend doing two things. 289.98 - #1. Cut yourself off from all new content. 294.227 - You should have already consumed enough through a course or whatever resources that 298.04 - you used to have a high-level view of what it looks like to execute on the marketing area you've chosen. 304.202 - By cutting out new content, you'll be able to stay laser-focused on actually practicing 309.531 - the fundamentals that will be an essential building block to your career. 314.26 - And #2 don't obsess over things that aren't moving your progress forward. 318.723 - For example, if you decide to build a hobby site so you can practice SEO, don't spend 323.669 - hours trying to fine-tune your logo, fonts or blog layout. 328.349 - As an SEO, you're going to want to focus on driving organic traffic through high rankings 333.311 - in Google. 334.077 - Now, if you're able to actually put all these things into practice, you will learn very quickly 339.39 - how to actually get results with SEO or social media or email marketing or whatever area you 345.268 - chose to focus on. 346.384 - Now, if you want to know the fastest way to accelerate your growth and to put this \"doing\" 351.08 - stage into overdrive, then I recommend getting a job or internship at an agency. 357.192 - When you work at an agency, you get the unique experience of being able to work on a diverse 362.105 - group of projects. 363.437 - Not only is the exposure great, but it forces you to stretch that creativity muscle and to 368.732 - apply your learning in various scenarios. 371.197 - Now, perhaps the biggest advantage to working at an agency is that you get to be in the trenches 376.676 - with people who are ahead of you in their digital marketing career. 380.223 - You can ask them questions, watch them solve problems, and in some cases, people may be 385.702 - willing to mentor you. 387.001 - Thriving agencies are usually fast-paced environments, which obviously make them 391.63 - a great place to learn digital marketing fast if that's your goal. 395.489 - Now, while you obviously want to learn new skills as fast as possible, don't make 399.907 - the mistake of taking shortcuts to get there. 402.188 - And I'm talking from experience here. 404.037 - Early in my career, I took an SEO shortcut that cost me seven-figures. 408.317 - So my first company was an ecommerce store and I was driving the majority of its traffic through SEO. 413.945 - Now, one of the hardest, but most important parts of SEO is getting backlinks to your pages. 419.591 - And back in 2010 and 2011, backlinks were pretty much all you needed to rank a page 424.62 - high in Google. 425.536 - So I came across a private blog network called Build My Rank where I could buy virtually 430.082 - an infinite number of backlinks. 432.231 - And without fail, throwing a handful of links at each product page would boost it to the top of 438.209 - Google for queries that were converting into tens of thousands of dollars every month. 443.588 - The thing is, buying backlinks was and still is against Google's webmaster guidelines. 449.233 - Now, while I was making a healthy living, I was getting ready to cash out. 452.914 - But without warning, I lost like 85% of my traffic and a ton of revenue. 458.226 - So when I sold the site a few months later, instead of getting a low seven-figure buyout, 463.705 - I ended up getting, much, much, much, much less. 466.886 - Now, had I focused on learning link building so I can build backlinks whenever I want, 471.765 - not only would I have had a much nicer exit, but I would have been able to apply those 476.378 - skills to pretty much every other SEO-driven business I created. 480.608 - Bottomline: avoid shortcuts because they can be costly. 484.121 - And you'll only really realize that in hindsight. 486.719 - Now, another thing I would do differently is to actually build relationships with people. 490.916 - So, for like the first 8 years of doing SEO, I literally didn't talk to anyone about what 496.278 - I did because most people just didn't understand. 499.426 - And it was lonely and I was really just stunting my professional growth. 503.239 - So what I would do differently if I could start over is try and network with two different 508.418 - groups of people. 509.401 - So, Group 1 would be like-minded people who are trying to learn the same area of digital 514.713 - marketing as you. 516.012 - They're basically a safe place where you can share your ideas, experiences, and insights 521.224 - without fear of judgment. 522.723 - And not only can you learn from each other, but you'll also find motivation from each 527.303 - other to get better at your craft. 529.351 - In fact, this is what Mr. Beast did with a group of friends in his early stages of his YouTube career. 534.464 - And in interviews, he frequently attributes his success to having this group of people 539.41 - to grow with. 540.409 - And the second group of people I'd network with are people you respect in your niche. 545.055 - All it really takes is an email or a DM saying, \"Hey, just wanted to let you know that I really 550.317 - admire your work. 551.45 - Thanks for all that you do!\" 552.799 - Now, that might sound weird, but at the end of the day, we're all just regular people. 557.029 - In fact, in 2017 when I started sending these kinds of emails, I reached out to Tim Soulo, 562.208 - CMO at Ahrefs, to just say that I respect what he's doing as a marketer \u2013 no agenda whatsoever. 568.469 - To which he replied: \"You've made my day!\" 570.684 - Fast forward one year, and I ended up working at Ahrefs. 574.115 - Relationships in digital marketing are important. 576.446 - In social media, these are people who can help amplify your work. 579.943 - On YouTube, these are potential collaborators. 582.824 - And in SEO, they're a critical part to link building. 586.255 - Now, as you continue to build your own sites, work at agencies or other companies, 590.901 - and network with like-minded people, you're going to come to a crossroad where you need to decide 597.112 - what's next. 598.195 - And I see three ways this can work \u2013 none of which I think are wrong or right. 602.341 - So option 1, you can continue to stay a generalist in your focus area. 606.505 - This means that you'll continue to build your knowledge and experience in most areas of 611.501 - your specific field in digital marketing. 614.099 - The pros with this is that generalists often become managers and leaders within companies 619.544 - because they get more or less every part of what's being done. 623.99 - The con is that you never really become an expert in anything, which obviously has its 629.453 - own set of limitations. 631.151 - Option 2, is to niche down further in your focus area. 634.998 - So as you gain more knowledge and experience in your focus area, you're going to realize that 639.894 - there's too much information to become a true expert in your field. 644.607 - And for that reason, you may want to consider niching down further because each digital 650.069 - marketing strategy breaks down quite a lot. 653.15 - For example, if you've chosen to focus on social media, you may decide to focus strictly 657.946 - on Facebook marketing. 659.157 - Or perhaps you want to go more niche and choose Facebook group marketing for software companies. 665.107 - Now, the pro of niching down is that it's much easier to become recognized as 669.387 - a niche authority because there's less competition. 672.467 - And if you're viewed as \"that\" authority, your reputation will likely be lasting and 677.88 - you can typically demand higher wages. 680.644 - The con is that there's usually less demand. 683.425 - And option 3 is to expand into other areas of digital marketing. 687.67 - And this is kind of the route that I've gone. 689.404 - The way I recommend doing this is to expand into areas where your skills are complementary 694.017 - and transferable. 695.149 - For example, starting from SEO and expanding to content marketing is complementary and 701.177 - the skills from SEO are totally transferable. 704.258 - And even something like going from SEO to search ads would also be complementary 709.054 - and some of those skills are transferable too. 711.702 - Now, being 14 years into my digital marketing career, I can confidently tell you that I'm still 717.514 - learning all the time. 719.462 - And that's largely because I'm practicing a lot of the things that I just shared with you. 723.659 -

a little activity then jade took her stickers like we once took a little one 311.76 - stuffed animal like that because last year we took a whole thing from her she had a crush 315.96 - on the stuffed animal so another stuffed animal and in the end they took the same thing from the girls because 320.36 - they ripped us off I'm going to show you after we got her took a little Labello there it's in the 324.12 - shape of a fox it's a key ring at the same time so here are the little extra gifts look 330.08 -

that which is a bit useless honestly for storage with a mirror and a little bit of 355.92 - makeup here and Lou took an activity box she took a box like that with mom S for 362.96 - for you my everything well it works inside there are little cards like this to color this is 367.8 - to color this it's stickers no it's not stickers in fact it's that well where 373.32 - they are they are inside that's why I left the cover we put it in we press 379.16 - then what do you do rubs and the color it transfers to your drawing ah nice there is the notice 385.4 - below roman he found the right body for wolf because in fact he was missing one 391.16 - but so that it could turn when yeah don't pay attention to the clothes behind are 394.16 - for my work so brief work the other very the troem then it has a little puzzle a little 402.24 - puzzle and behind it is colored and more yeah there are two one ah no it's returned ok UNEF 408.4 - on the other side you can it color then what is this is sand to do what is this wait 412.44 - I can explain to him in fact we take this after look there it's there we take this we put like this 419.92 - in we take this we open it we tip it over inside we put the thing at the same time and after we put 426.88 - no we don't we put it like that we do that after we change color each time and that 434.0 - makes us a unicorn and a little bit for the crystal wait for the crystal where is it when I 'was 440.6 - in a bcal yeah in the pex in green and you put the floors of that for Mother's Day and all 446.52 - yeah I think we all do that so that's it, we don't buy you anything in anyway 451.76 - here we go don't hang around too much because it's already mid-15 Wolf in Gy we have to leave in 30 minutes 456.56 - I think I'll warm up the PES bolo from last night for him and we'll do something else 461.68 - and well I'll do half and half I'll meet you later and we took it as usual at Action 518.6 - well as you can imagine it's the next morning I just got back from the races so 522.24 - a little return from the races in any case usually I'm always happy like when I do 525.68 - the drifts said I'm coming everything is ready and so on I waited 25 minutes well they can't help it they 530.6 - have a lot of work but in fact I wait outside every time because I'm afraid to be 533.92 - in my car not to see that he's 'wait like that with the shopping cart and so I wait outside and 537.96 - every time I wanted to get into my car because I'm really cold I told myself 541.4 - at any moment I'll sit down, he's coming I have to get out so I waited like that for 544.96 - almost a year half an hour I saw all the cars arrive leave arrive leave but I don't know 549.36 - she didn't tell me anything she didn't tell me like there was a problem or something just I waited 553.32 - so for once this drive there instead to save me time it made me waste a little bit 557.24 - but hey it doesn't matter I'll show you all that quickly I took it with black soap because 561.24 - that's what I use to clean the furniture you know how it has infi mat we 565.4 - often see the fingerprints with I don't know about the cleaning products when you cook, 569.56 - open the fridge and everything and that's one of the only things that really makes you go away and which 573.32 - ultimately you see absolutely nothing afterwards so if ever on the matte surfaces of black soap is 578.24 - great then I took my toothpaste again this one is my favorite it's the White now gold yeah 583.4 - gold that one not the not the silver really the the golden one I'll give you a little rap about yesterday right after 589.28 - because I have to put it away well I took some croustibates just in case I know it's not 592.4 - super mega good but for Wednesday lunch as you know it's the race I take that at 596.68 - least I know that I have something backup and then it's surg and therefore it keeps for a very long time 601.04 - grated mozzarella like usually I made my recipes on Joe because lately I haven't 605.32 - been cooking too much, I admit, I was doing the things she had quickly, we were doing small errands, 609.04 - I was always looking for ideas and so this morning I decided concentrated on it I made 612.6 - my whole little list and there normally I have a few recipes it seems to me that I had 616.44 - around ten or so 10 recipes including small sandwiches for lunch and everything to 620.84 - prepare yourself but there you go I took everything from Jo's eggs meat it's rare that we eat 626.0 - red meat but from time to time it changes afterwards I admit that the girls are not very fans 629.6 - they don't really like meat in general like that but at worst it will be for Romain and me 633.28 - and I'll make them something else, chicken breast at the moment I'm all about chicken breast I 637.28 - think it's really good for lunch like that or in sandwiches and so on so I bought 641.96 - two packs frankly Roman chicken pans he's tired of me eat chicken 646.04 - 24/7 but it's the only meat I like and I'm used to always putting meat 651.24 - somewhere so anyway uh yeah that's really good that's what I do sometimes at oven with 655.12 - mozzarella or there I said to myself for lunch when I'm all alone z quick county 660.28 - mozza which it seems to me that in one of the recipes there was a kind of risotto with 664.92 - county kind of ham or whatever want to try something next maybe I will film this week 670.24 - a week on my plate I had thought about doing it last week but in the end there were 673.2 - plenty of times where I didn't have time to film because I do cook quickly because I'm 676.44 - in the middle of work and so on so in the end I didn't do it this week I'm going to try to do it 680.04 - this week which is coming, calm down some cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche because I planned to make a quiche 684.24 - Loren girls love it pizza dough and dough Broken, I told myself that we were going to do a little 688.36 - pizza workshop with the girls. It's to make some kind of Margarita, you know, it's very 692.56 - simple, but at least they'll add what they want on it and we'll try. to 695.88 - make heart-shaped pizzas are happy chorizo \u200b\u200bchifonette that's for making 699.88 - grilled sandwiches with chorizo \u200b\u200bcheese that looks really good the same I took a 705.04 - shrimp rizoto so there with risotto rice I didn't think there would be so little but I hope 709.24 - it will be enough how much does it make 200 g for 4 I don't know I don't know so good for 714.76 - the quiche Lorine desardon the girls they have had lots of cards there I still want to 718.48 - look if there's anything golden no I won't open them completely otherwise I'll get argued no no 723.68 - no and no B well we won't go to Disneyland for parmesan it's parmesan that's great no grated ring 731.52 - good I think it's like parmesan and salmon steaks where I avoided the accident of 737.52 - white wine for the risotto tomato coulis and vegetable broth I like that one here I 742.12 - find that it is super good in soups in everything chicken stock good after that it's 746.64 - basic pasta bread again tomato and in the last bag I took two broccoli in there 753.12 - we have tomatoes body of beef and cucumbers, salad and potatoes that's it for the 758.32 - return from the race now we have to tidy up I admit that I have been feeling super stressed since this morning I 761.88 - think that you can hear it because I have to speak a little a little faster than usual but my 764.96 - heart is racing but I think it's just because I went to get a drive in fact 768.64 - as soon as I go out by myself it does this to me it stresses me out to the max it's for that also that I 772.8 - go drive instead of going shopping alone like everyone else but yeah I 776.96 - don't even know that it stresses me out for each STI alone I have to prepare at least 15 to 30 minutes 782.36 - in advance psychologically before going out good I'll put it away quietly and I'll see you 787.2 - later so a quick debrief on yesterday while Louis was at the Gy at the very beginning 812.56 - we went to the library for a bit since Jade's birthday was right next 816.68 - door. she was able to borrow three books she was happy we will go back soon for wolf 820.52 - I think because she wants to go and get some too and then she went to celebrate 823.92 - her friend's birthday honestly it was a really good idea they sewed little ones 828.32 - to bag it was a sewing workshop so with all the sewing machines and so on Jad 832.56 - loved it honestly it was a good idea afterwards when we went to get them we went straight 836.48 - to Romain's parents and in fact we ate there- downstairs we played a little bit of cards 840.6 - and afterward we ate a couscous and we came home I think around 9 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. something like that 845.64 - so that's why I didn't take you back and besides we watched an episode of the 849.52 - cross series on prime video honestly it's is not bad at all it's Romain who found it and frankly 854.2 - it's well shot the episodes they last 1 hour for the moment there is only one season 858.08 - but there is intrigue et cetera it looks pretty good maybe it will be in my favorites 861.72 - of the month we'll see at the end in any case yeah that's it for yesterday I said to myself that I would 865.8 - show you a little more how it goes with the girls and so on you will tell me 869.52 - what you think about it I have two little colers to open and then I think I will leave you 873.68 - it will not be very very long this vlog but in fact I have to work I have a lot 877.16 - a lot of things to do so we're going to do it like this to today the first package is benefit 881.64 - in it they gave me four products the first is the diprrit cool scrubbing clay mask 887.44 - it's from the professional range I already have several care products from this range this one 892.52 - doesn't mean anything to me I think I have a yellow and a blue one but not purple so it's a mask 896.72 - to leave on for how long it mattifies for 12 12 hours it's not marked in French 900.56 - if mattifying action during 12h soft and comfortable texture caolin rich in minerals to help 906.4 - purify pigs will test oh it's purple so funny good it smells of clay I love the smell of 911.36 - clay I think it smells it smells clean we will test I will turn me into a purple monster I 915.72 - think but to test ah so good a powder I just finished mine this morning in fact I 921.68 - thought because I bought it on Black Friday it was the Anastasia Beverly 925.44 - Hills powder that I had taken it on Amazon suddenly lasted me a good year between two I use the typology et 930.04 - cetera but in itself it lasted me a year even though it was a big pot I had paid 12 \u20ac instead of 935.6 - 50 and something I think I'll look this year to see if he still has it. In any case, it's 939.52 - the loose setting and mattifying powder with a blurring effect, still from the same range. I 945.0 - can't wait to try it. I don't think I've ever tried it. powder from Benefit it is slightly 949.2 - tinted finally it is nude it is not tinted I think I can't wait to try it if you have already 953.72 - tried it don't hesitate to tell me if it is good then they gave me a little Gimmy Bro plus 957.44 - in shade 3.6 75 so it's the warm medium Brown shade which is my shade before I always took 963.24 - the dark brown shade I think it was always too dark so it seems to me that that's it 968.56 - yeah and this one is not bad because that you can redraw a little bit on your eyebrows 972.52 - thanks to the little picot brush like that and to finish they gave me the bad galbang mascara 977.64 - in intense shade Peach black, it's so good, this one is not at all the type of brush that 982.96 - I I usually like I'm going to show you I like you know brushes with 986.52 - very thick hairs a bit like the better one it's from Too Faced I thought it was the best 991.32 - for lengthening the eyelashes and all in the end in mini Picot like that in kind of silicone it lengthens 997.04 - the eyelashes but like it really separates them et cetera it is really very good this one I 1001.36 - had tested it in small it separates the eyelashes well however I have a little Asian eyelashes so 1004.88 - they fall downwards and very straight and this one manages to cut them well well the separate 1010.0 - it I really like it I also received a package from lounge he had already sent me a package a 1014.76 - long time ago it was at the old apartment so we're going to look they offered me to see 1019.16 - some pieces because that in fact right now it's Black Friday so there are lots of offers 1022.36 - on their site if you want to check it out and so there are lots of discounts is it embarrassing 1026.24 - to show you well we wear almost all of them in any case if ever I will display the name of the 1030.64 - sets on the screen because I don't have the names anymore unless it's written no first 1035.12 - I took this in blue the blue it's super pretty so it's lace and nice details there 1040.84 - we have a whale I prefer to specify because I know that there are those who prefer when it is 1044.04 - completely flexible and so we have the little bottom that goes with it then I have this set which 1049.0 - is a bit the same model here we still have the transparent lace side and here we have the support and 1053.92 - the little lounge logo in the middle and the bottom I don't know why it bothers me more to show the bottoms 1058.4 - than the tops if you ever want to see them better than what I show you you can see 1061.84 - them I will put the links in the description and some so we have the third one a little softer it 1066.24 - is very very beautiful frankly the models they are super beautiful the finishes they are really 1069.64 - well done little bows there we have the bottom that goes with it finally here is for the small packages since 1074.72 - there It's going to be Black Friday soon, are you interested? that I make you a selection 1078.28 - of the best offers on the sites and so on or you don't care I said to myself 1082.72 - that if you are like me and you buy Christmas gifts on the internet it could 1086.0 - perhaps help you so tell me and also tell me if you prefer that I do this for you on 1089.68 - video with a whole selection of the site et cetera or if you prefer that I do this in reels 1095.68 - in very fast mode without necessarily detailing and in reels what is annoying is that I can't 1100.4 - give you the links or it works very rarely sometimes I paste them in the comments but 1103.96 - you can't copy and paste you can't click on them so I can make you a 1107.76 - special Black Friday video with all the offers if you're ever interested after making a 1111.64 - selection Christmas gifts also for women men children decoration in short tell me beauty 1117.52 - also Black Friday frankly it's the best time on the internet for everything that is 1121.16 - Christmas gift so tell me that in any case I'm sorry but I'll tell you leave here I feel like 1125.12 - I haven't shown you a lot of things in this vlog but in the end I showed you 1128.8 - what we did with our weekend so I still hope you liked it in any case we 1132.52 - 'll see you again on Wednesday for a new video I'll give you very very big kisses 1136.48 - take good care of yourself and enjoy your day and your evening big kisses and see you soon"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:44 - Introduction and Morning Routine 1:50 - Heading Out and Errands 2:57 - Shopping for Jade\u2019s Birthday Gift 4:18 - Family Time and Action Store Adventures 6:20 - Returning Home and Gift Unpacking 8:18 - Next Morning Grocery Haul 12:56 - Recap of Jade\u2019s Birthday and Family Evening 14:20 - Packages and Product Unboxing 17:44 - Black Friday Preparations and Gift Suggestions 19:25 - Conclusion and Farewell"}]}

[Music] 2.24 - hi welcome to animation for anyone my 4.24 - name's alex today's lesson is a bit of a 6.72 - crash course in animation we'll start 9.2 - with how animation works and then i'll 11.2 - share with you the six ideas that i 12.799 - think are the most important to 13.92 - understand when you first start 15.599 - animating and after that i want to show 17.76 - you my thought process but how we can 19.6 - use multiple animation ideas at the same 22.16 - time let's jump in 24.56 - i think the easiest way to understand 26.32 - how animation is working is by looking 28.24 - at a flip book if you're anything like 30.8 - me you might have made little animation 32.399 - flip books out of your exercise books at 34.16 - school you draw a picture and then a 36.399 - slightly different picture and you keep 38.239 - going until you flip through your pages 40.079 - and see your pictures move 42.0 - this is how pretty much all animation 43.92 - works 44.8 - recreate still images and play them back 47.2 - quickly to create the illusion of motion 50.399 - if you've never tried it maybe spend a 52.0 - few minutes now it's pretty fun 54.239 - flipbooks are a good way to visualize 56.0 - animation but they're a little bit hard 57.92 - to demonstrate the ideas i want to 59.52 - explore today so instead i'm going to 61.6 - use a coin and capture the visuals 63.68 - digitally that lets me play back the 65.76 - animation at a constant predictable 68.0 - speed of 24 frames per second 70.72 - in future videos i'll show you how to do 72.56 - this but for now we're really just 74.32 - looking at the ideas behind the 75.759 - animation and how to plan out the 77.52 - movement so if i want to animate this 80.0 - coin moving from one side of the piece 81.759 - of paper to the other i take a picture 84.159 - of it move it a little and then take 86.24 - another picture and then keep going 88.159 - until i get to the other side 90.88 - now when i play the images back it feels 93.04 - as though the coin is moving across the 94.72 - screen looking at it though i think it 96.64 - feels a bit weird 98.479 - i think the most important question you 100.479 - can ask yourself while you're animating 102.799 - is how does this motion feel 105.2 - this is my guiding principle while i 107.28 - animate 108.72 - all of the fundamentals we talk about 110.24 - today and in future lessons really come 112.159 - back to this one question so if i ask 114.799 - myself how does this motion feel 117.68 - i'd probably describe it as jumpy or 120.719 - jittery 122.56 - let's look at why that might be 123.84 - happening 124.96 - below the coin i've illustrated the 126.719 - exact spacing of each of the frames 130.399 - you can see that it's not very even 132.879 - there are frames that are really close 134.16 - together and there are frames that are 135.44 - really far apart from each other and 137.04 - that's because i've not been very 138.319 - deliberate about how far i move the coin 140.239 - each time 142.08 - so if this motion feels jumpy or jittery 144.64 - now i think we can make the motion feel 146.64 - a bit smoother by making the spacing 148.959 - between the coins a little bit more even 153.68 - now that i've evened up the spacing you 155.519 - can see that the coin moves a little bit 157.36 - more consistently across the screen 159.28 - there's no more jumpiness at the moment 161.76 - the coin moves across the screen in one 163.84 - second 164.8 - or 24 pictures let's see what happens if 167.599 - i move it across the screen in less time 170.16 - i think we can see two really clear 171.92 - things here 173.44 - the coin moves much faster and the 175.44 - spacing between the coin is much larger 177.519 - than before 178.64 - let's see what happens if we make the 180.319 - coin take longer to cross the screen 184.48 - okay i think that the results here are 186.0 - pretty clear as well the coin feels like 188.159 - it's moving more slowly and the spacing 190.4 - between the coin is much closer than 192.239 - before so this is the first big idea and 194.4 - animation i wanted to show you things 196.64 - feel fast when they're far apart and 199.12 - slow when they're closer together so if 201.2 - i ask myself now how does this motion 203.36 - feel i'd say smooth or consistent but 207.599 - maybe a little unnatural 209.92 - the coin starts moving suddenly and then 212.0 - stops moving suddenly 213.84 - so if we wanted to make a more natural 215.519 - feeling the coin could start moving 217.44 - slowly speed up in the middle and then 219.599 - slow down at the end we start slow by 222.0 - having the coins closer together and 223.84 - then gradually get further and further 225.519 - apart and then we slow the coin down by 227.519 - making the spacing closer and closer 229.84 - until we come to a stop 234.0 - i think that's starting to feel a bit 235.519 - more natural 236.72 - for this next step i'm going to loop the 238.64 - animation so that the coin travels from 240.64 - the left of the screen to the right and 242.159 - then back again 243.76 - using the exact same spacing 245.76 - for this next step i'm going to 247.36 - exaggerate the speeding up and slowing 248.799 - down a little 249.92 - you can see that the spacing's changed 251.84 - so the parts that were close together 253.28 - before are even closer together now and 255.599 - the parts that are far apart are even 257.359 - further apart 260.639 - let's see what happens if we exaggerate 262.56 - it even more 266.08 - you can see now it feels a bit more 267.44 - lively or zippy 270.08 - we don't always have to start slow and 271.6 - finish though either here's an example 273.52 - of how changing the acceleration can 275.68 - entirely change the way the motion feels 278.16 - in this example i have a coin that 279.919 - slowly speeds up gets really fast and 282.4 - then changes direction suddenly this 284.4 - gives us a kind of bouncy feeling one 286.8 - thing that i think is quite important to 288.16 - mention at this point is that these 289.919 - motions all feel quite different but 291.919 - they have the exact same timing 294.24 - they all take 24 frames to get from one 296.32 - side of the screen to the other all of 298.16 - the difference in the way that they feel 300.0 - comes from the amount of space we put 301.6 - between the frames 303.84 - so this is the second big idea i wanted 306.08 - to show you if we want to make things 307.919 - slow down or speed up we gradually get 310.24 - closer and closer together or further 312.0 - and further apart from each other this 313.919 - is called acceleration and deceleration 316.56 - some people call it easing or you can 318.479 - just call it speeding up and slowing 319.919 - down 320.88 - so far all of our animation has been 322.4 - done using a coin which doesn't change 324.8 - shape 325.6 - i'm going to start using a cut out piece 327.36 - of paper so that we can change the shape 329.52 - as we animate 331.199 - in this first example i'm going to take 332.8 - the fastest frame of animation and 334.8 - stretch the frame out a little this 336.72 - changes the feeling of the animation i 338.56 - think it feels a little less rigid 340.96 - maybe more zippy more lively 348.56 - let's try changing the shape again but 350.639 - this time we'll squash it i think the 352.4 - best example to demonstrate squash would 354.8 - be our bouncy animation 357.12 - i'll start by stretching out the frame 358.72 - where we're moving the fastest 360.72 - and then squash it where we change 362.72 - direction this is going to make it feel 364.88 - a little bit more like a bouncing ball 370.4 - squash stretch is the third big idea i 373.039 - wanted to share with you 374.639 - it's great for adding a little bit of 376.319 - life to your animation and making it 378.24 - feel less rigid 379.759 - it also really helps the audience 381.28 - understand what the object is made of 383.12 - this coin doesn't squash a stretch as it 384.72 - bounces so it feels quite hard whereas a 387.52 - rubber ball might squash and stretch 389.199 - heaps which is what makes it feel 391.28 - rubbery and stretchy 394.0 - so that's three big ideas covered and 396.16 - i've got three more i want to show you 398.56 - the first is anticipation 401.6 - anticipation is a really important part 403.36 - of animation but it's something that's 405.039 - easy to forget about when you're first 406.56 - starting out anticipation does two key 409.44 - things it builds up energy 412.319 - and it also gives the audience an 413.919 - indication that something's about to 415.52 - happen which really helps with clarity 419.199 - when i think of anticipation i think of 420.88 - a spring 422.4 - it builds up energy in one direction and 424.72 - then releases it all at once in the 426.639 - opposite direction 429.44 - you might like to think of someone 430.72 - jumping before they jump up in the air 432.96 - they often move down to build tension in 434.96 - their body this downwards motion is the 437.199 - anticipation in this example i have a 439.36 - ball that moves quite suddenly and then 441.12 - slows down to make it feel more natural 443.12 - i could add a little bit of squash to 445.039 - anticipate the movement this makes it 446.88 - feel like we're building up energy and 448.56 - releasing it all at once 454.56 - the fifth idea i'd like to talk about is 456.4 - overshoot 457.599 - overshoot is like a mirror image to 460.0 - anticipation imagine you have a really 462.16 - big movement go too far and then bounce 464.479 - back 465.28 - overshoot helps add weight or 466.96 - springiness to your animation in this 469.12 - example i've added a double overshoot to 471.039 - the ball as it springs back into place 475.12 - you might have noticed that all of our 476.479 - motion so far has been along a straight 478.479 - line the last idea i'd like to talk 480.479 - about today is arcs 484.479 - things in nature don't usually follow a 486.639 - perfectly straight line more often than 488.8 - not natural movements follow some sort 490.8 - of arc arcs tend to add flow to your 493.12 - motion 496.639 - in this example i've taken our coin and 498.96 - rather than moving it directly across 500.479 - the page 501.44 - i've swung it down like a pendulum this 503.759 - gives it an entirely different feeling 508.56 - okay so those are the six big ideas i 510.72 - wanted to talk about today let's have a 512.8 - bit of a recap our first idea was about 515.039 - speed if we make things closer together 517.36 - they move more slowly and if we make 518.88 - them further apart they move more 520.56 - quickly our second idea is about spacing 523.039 - and acceleration if we gradually get 525.2 - closer and closer together or further 526.959 - and further apart things feel like 528.64 - they're slowing down or getting faster 532.399 - the third idea is about squash and 533.839 - stretch and how using it can add a bit 535.92 - of life to your motion and also give the 537.839 - audience a sense of what your objects 539.92 - are made of 541.44 - the fourth idea is about adding 542.8 - anticipation to your motion 544.8 - this will help build up energy and 547.36 - sometimes add clarity our fifth idea is 550.0 - overshoot this is where we let objects 551.92 - bounce back after big movement and our 554.399 - sixth idea is about arcs this is where 557.2 - we decide if we want our motion to 558.64 - follow a straight line or a more natural 560.8 - flowing arc through space 562.959 - so the question is how do we use all of 565.04 - these ideas at the same time 567.12 - if you're working on an animation you 569.04 - can ask yourself how does this motion 571.04 - feel 571.839 - the answer could be anywhere from it's 573.839 - great i love it 575.279 - to could be better or it could just be 578.56 - this feels wrong 580.0 - if your answer is anything other than 581.68 - great i love it you can use these ideas 584.16 - to start asking questions that will help 586.64 - improve your animation does the speed 588.56 - feel right should we change the spacing 590.8 - to adjust the acceleration 592.8 - should we be using some squash or 594.64 - stretch 595.6 - or maybe we need some anticipation are 598.0 - the arcs working well or do we need some 600.0 - overshoot to help sell the weight i'm 602.56 - going to walk through a simple animation 604.24 - now and use these questions to help push 606.72 - our animation to the great i love it 608.399 - part of the graph here 611.12 - so for this animation i'm trying to make 612.88 - a bull jump in the air and land on the 614.88 - other side of the screen 617.6 - let's just move the ball upwards upwards 620.32 - upwards and then come back down again 623.04 - it takes one second or 24 frames to get 625.839 - to that point 627.12 - and let's play back at full speed 630.959 - now if i ask myself how does this motion 633.04 - feel i'd say not that great 636.0 - it feels unnatural it feels stiff it 638.079 - doesn't have any weight to it 640.24 - so this is where we can start asking 641.76 - those questions 643.12 - and apply those animation ideas that 644.959 - we've been talking about i'll start with 646.8 - the most obvious thing to me at least 649.279 - i think this motion could use an arc 651.76 - if i imagine a cannibal flying through 653.6 - the air i don't imagine a straight line 655.68 - up and a straight line down i picture 657.44 - more of an arc this is because it's 659.2 - being affected by gravity so let's add 661.519 - an arc to this motion 666.24 - okay so i think that's starting to feel 667.76 - better straight away 670.959 - let's see what other ideas we can start 672.48 - working into this animation 674.48 - i think we could use some squash to 676.48 - create an anticipation so it feels like 678.399 - the ball is building up energy before 680.16 - the jump i think that we could 681.6 - exaggerate the acceleration by using a 683.92 - couple of frames of stretch in the 685.68 - fastest part of the motion and we could 687.36 - also use a bit of squash to create an 689.68 - overshoot when the ball lands this will 691.519 - give it a bit more weight and make it 692.959 - feel a bit more springy 703.839 - okay i think that's looking even better 705.76 - it's a totally usable piece of animation 708.399 - but if i ask myself one more time how 710.48 - does this motion feel i'd say it falls 712.56 - into this area here 716.079 - so if i look at these ideas again i can 718.079 - think about which ideas i could 719.68 - exaggerate even more 721.279 - i think that we could push the 722.32 - anticipation even further 724.399 - so it feels like it's shaking and 725.76 - building up energy just before it jumps 727.839 - i think that i could fine tune the 729.12 - spacing a little bit more so that the 730.72 - acceleration is clearer as it leaves the 732.72 - ground and i think that i could 734.0 - exaggerate the overshoot even more by 735.76 - adding a stretch frame this means that 737.519 - it'll have a kind of double overshoot 739.2 - making it feel really springy 742.0 - and this is the final result 745.279 - i think that it's got a lot more energy 746.8 - and personality now 748.639 - and that's it six of the biggest ideas 750.399 - in animation and how to start applying 752.079 - them to any animation you want to make 754.0 - thanks for sticking with me now for some 756.079 - homework 757.12 - choose an animation medium it could be 758.8 - anything from a flipbook to a program 761.519 - that you're learning and take one of the 763.04 - six ideas we've talked about here today 765.04 - like anticipation or arcs 768.0 - and create a short animation based on 769.92 - that maybe one to two seconds long then 772.56 - take a different idea maybe squash or 774.88 - stretch 775.839 - and create a second animation once again 778.32 - one to two seconds long and lastly 780.32 - create a short animation that uses both 782.56 - of these ideas at the same time 784.8 - hopefully you've enjoyed this crash 786.24 - course we'll be looking at these 787.76 - individual ideas and many more in future 790.079 - episodes see you next time 799.31 - [Music] 817.12 - you"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to Animation Crash Course 0:24 -

4.251 - First are the academic courses. 5.875 - These are for those who are about to join an MBA college. 9.152 - And the second are profile building courses, 11.26 - which CAT aspirants can also do, 13.033 - or those who will be joining soon can also do. 14.905 - First are the academic courses. 16.58 - That is, to make your 2-year MBA journey easier, 20.819 - what should you do in advance? 22.807 - In this, you should do 3 courses. 24.795 - Statistics, Accounts, and basic skills. 27.564 - The first one is the statistics course. 29.452 - Basically, whatever your Quant classes will be like, 31.956 - there are some topics that will be useful for you, 34.436 - such as Probability, Regression, Distribution, 37.429 - Standard Deviation, Variance, and Sampling. 39.739 - If you study these topics in advance, 42.432 - it will be very helpful for you in Quant subjects. 45.342 - Because I was a non-engineer, 46.63 - I know how much difficulty those classes felt. 49.576 - While for engineers, it was a cake walk. 51.734 - So let me recommend you the same course 53.658 - which IIM Ahmedabad offers on Coursera. 56.527 - It's called \"Pre-MBA Statistics\". 58.486 - If you check its modules, 60.486 - all the topics I mentioned are covered in it. 63.351 - You can finish this course within a day. 66.001 - You can pursue it for free. 67.622 - How do you do that? 68.53 - You click on 'Enroll for Free' and then two options appear. 72.178 - From these, you just press the 'Audit' button, 74.592 - and then you won't receive any certificate. 76.435 - And you don't need any certificate. 78.186 - This is only necessary for your academic knowledge. 80.704 - The second course is about accounts. 82.261 - What topics are covered in it? 83.688 - Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and basic journaling. 86.386 - Meaning what 'debit' and 'credit' are. 88.127 - Now, because I was from a commerce background, 90.0 - this was easy for me but engineers find it quite difficult. 93.61 - So let me suggest you a free course. 95.103 - This is also on Coursera; It's called Pre-MBA Accounting. 98.432 - This is offered by Rice University. 99.929 - And you can complete it within a day. 102.409 - Everything is covered in it. 103.588 - How do you enroll in this?

269.2 - What things will help you? Those courses. 271.761 - Let's start with those courses that 273.389 - you need to showcase in your resume, 275.2 - meaning they should be show-worthy. 276.955 - Now, within this, there are further two bifurcations. 279.15 - One is \"General Courses\" meaning those courses that 281.571 - will add value to your resume regardless of the job 284.146 - you are applying for. 285.851 - And the second is specialization-based courses. 288.516 - For this, I will individually provide you with courses 290.857 - for Marketing, Finance, and HR. 292.662 - The first course is Data Analytics. 295.0 - You'll need data analytics in every field. 297.371 - Especially because you'll be making decisions using data. 300.234 - For this, the course you can take is from LinkedIn and 303.056 - Microsoft which is called \"Career Essentials in Data Analysis\". 306.615 - This is a 9-hour course that anyone can take for free. 309.572 - After completing it, you will also receive a certificate. 312.474 - The second is presentation skills. 314.37 - You will have to present in every company, 317.231 - whether it's PPTs based on the problem statement, 319.822 - and solving it will also require data. 321.882 - There is a course on Coursera called 323.831 - \"Data Analysis in Presentation Skills\" by PwC. 327.202 - But this is a very comprehensive specialization. 329.758 - You'll get certification only if you complete all 5 courses. 333.414 - It involves a lot of investment of time as well as money. 336.611 - If you can devote a total of 10 hours and 339.278 - pay a cost of 4000, then you should take up this course. 342.968 - This will basically help you showcase 345.0 - both your data and presentation skills. 347.371 - The third skill is leadership skills. 349.477 - Basically, in any job, you will have to manage a team. 353.011 - For this, IIM Ahmedabad has created a course, 355.415 - which you can find on Coursera. 356.959 - Its name is \"Leadership Skills by IIM Ahmedabad.\" 359.479 - It will take you a total of 2 days to complete this course. 362.354 - So, this is another course that you can take up. 364.042 - So, these are the three \"General Courses.\" 366.361 - Now, let's move on to specialization-based courses. 368.943 - I will mention a total of six specializations: Finance, 372.036 - Marketing, HR, Operations, Product, and Consulting. 375.797 - For each of these, I will directly add the links 378.419 - to the individual courses in the description. 381.071 - If I go into detail about each course, 383.0 - it will take quite a bit of time. 384.341 - Whichever specialization you are interested in, 386.388 - you can simply check out the link in the description 388.83 - and pursue those courses. 390.253 - So now we have covered the show-worthy courses 392.679 - that will add value to your resume 394.473 - and potentially get you shortlisted for interviews. 397.118 - But now we need to convert that placement interview. 400.093 - So I'm sharing resources with you for that. 402.312 - These are not courses because to convert the interview, 405.0 - you'll need to demonstrate your skills 406.393 - for which you'll need some resources. 407.985 - The first thing you'll need is case study solving. 410.735 - In many interviews, you are given a case problem 413.836 - that you need to diagnose. 415.541 - For example, if someone tells you that last month 418.115 - a business manufacturer's profits decreased, 421.274 - then you need to analyze what happened. 423.796 - In this process, you ask several clarifying questions. 426.033 - Like whether the supply was across all of India 428.318 - or limited to specific states? 430.0 - How many warehouses were there? 431.581 - In this way, by asking clarifying questions 433.778 - you diagnose the actual problem. 435.974 - Now, how is this solved? 437.868 - For this, there is a book used the most in IIMs, 441.399 - its name is \"Case in Point.\" 443.235 - I will share a document with you. 445.118 - It's basically a link to a drive where 447.062 - all those case books are added that we have at IIMs. 450.469 - You will find case books from many colleges in this. 453.22 - The second skill you need is guesstimates. 455.865 - Guesstimate means, for example, if you have to 458.35 - estimate the area of India, how would you do it? 461.247 - In the same way, if I ask you to estimate how many flights 463.895 - depart from Delhi in one day, 466.342 - then what approach would you follow? 468.384 - How do you think about this problem? 470.257 - That is how you solve a guesstimate. 472.174 - Now, how to solve this? 473.43 - For that, let me share about one of my classmates 475.915 - Aditya Aggarwal, who was the topper of our batch. 478.524 - When he created this channel, 480.424 - I was in my undergraduate college at that time. 482.98 - And he has shared how to solve 485.0 - these guesstimates in an excellent way. 487.042 - So, I am going to link one of his playlists 489.077 - where he has given examples of these cases. 491.119 - You go through them, and you will learn 492.848 - how to solve this skill of guesstimates. 495.138 - The final skill that you need in order to crack those 498.058 - interviews is called HRQs (Human Resource Questions). 501.678 - This means questions like \"Please introduce yourself.\"  503.738 - What are some strengths and weaknesses? 505.407 - What challenges have you faced? 507.727 - Can you tell us about a time when you managed a team? 509.556 - Now, to prepare for these,  511.113 - we were given a list at IIM Ahmedabad 513.438 - that had many questions. 515.112 - So what I will do is: I will share this list in front of you. 518.359 - You can take a screenshot of it. 520.084 - Or you can note it down. 521.856 - And you can try framing the answers yourself 523.899 - before your interview. 525.174 - So these are basically all sorts of courses 527.376 - that you can do for an MBA. 528.993 - Whether it is well before your MBA 531.164 - or during your MBA journey for your placements. 533.663 - I truly hope that this video helps you. 535.5 - Thank you so much for watching this. 536.726 - And see you the next time!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Pre-MBA and Profile-Building Courses 0:24 - Academic Courses: Statistics, Accounts, and Basic Skills 1:04 - Statistics Course Recommendation: Pre-MBA Statistics on Coursera 1:48 - Accounts Course Recommendation: Pre-MBA Accounting by Rice University 2:50 - Basic Skills: Excel, Word, and PowerPoint Essentials 3:38 - Profile-Building Courses: Resume and Placement Preparation 4:50 - Show-Worthy Courses: Data Analytics, Presentation, and Leadership Skills 5:55 - Specialization-Based Courses: Finance, Marketing, HR, and More 6:47 - Interview Preparation: Case Studies, Guesstimates, and HR Questions 8:20 - Summary: Essential MBA Preparation Tips"}]}

Your purportedly free markets 9.24 - only makes slave of us all.. 11.15 - Oh god Stan, it's me from college. Me from the past has become me from college. This 14.599 - is a disaster! The reason he's so unbearable, Stan, is that he refuses to recognize the 18.44 - legitimacy of other people's narratives. And that means that he will never ever be able 22.98 - to have a productive conversation with another human in his entire life. 26.13 - So listen, me from the past. I'm gonna disappoint you by being too capitalist. And I'm gonna 29.519 - disappoint a lot of other people by not being capitalist enough. And I'm gonna disappoint 32.77 - the historians by not using enough jargon. But what can I do? We only have twelve minutes! 37.3 - Fortunately, capitalism is all about efficiency. 39.23 - So let's do this, me from college: Randy [Ransom] Riggs becomes a best-selling author, Josh 42.53 - Radnor stars in a great sitcom, it is NOT going to work out with Emily, and do NOT go 47.03 - to Alaska with a girl you've known for ten days. Okay, let's talk capitalism. 59.55 - So capitalism is an economic system, but it's also a cultural system. It's characterized 63.059 - by innovation and investment to increase wealth. But today, we're going to focus on production 66.88 - and how industrial capitalism changed it. Stan, I can't wear these emblems of the bourgeoisie 70.85 - while Karl Marx himself is looking at me, it's ridiculous. 76.9 - I'm changing! Very hard to take off a shirt dramatically. 81.42 - So let's say it's 1200 CE and you're a rug merchant. Just like merchants today, you sometimes 85.72 - need to borrow money in order to buy the rugs you want to resell at a profit, and then you 89.84 - pay that money back, often with interest, once you've resold the rugs. This is called 93.97 - mercantile capitalism, and it was a global phenomenon, from the Chinese, to the Indian 97.479 - Ocean trade network, to Muslim merchants who would sponsor trade caravans across the Sahara. 101.759 - But by the 17th century, merchants in the Netherlands and in Britain had expanded upon 105.31 - this idea to create joint stock companies. Those companies could finance bigger trade 109.24 - missions and also spread the risk of international trade. But the thing about international trade 113.2 - is that sometimes boats sink or they get taken by pirates, and while that's bad if you're 117.42 - a sailor because, you know, you lose your life, it's really bad if you're a mercantile 121.28 - capitalist because you lost all your money. But if you own one-tenth of ten boats, your 125.759 - risk is much better managed. That kind of investment definitely increased wealth, but 129.44 - it only affected a sliver of the population and it didn't create a culture of capitalism. 134.62 - Industrial capitalism was something altogether different, both in scale and in practice. 138.44 - Let's use Joyce Appleby's definition of industrial capitalism: \"An economic system that relies on 142.62 - investment of capital in machines and technology that are used to increase production of marketable goods.\" 148.4 - So imagine that someone made a Stan machine (by the way Stan, this is a remarkable likeness) 152.23 - and that Stan machine could produce and direct 10 times more episodes of Crash Course than 156.48 - a human Stan. Well, of course, even if there are upfront costs I'm going to invest in a 161.12 - Stan machine so I can start cranking out 10 times the knowledge - Stan, are you focusing 165.08 - on the robot instead of me? I AM THE STAR OF THE SHOW. Stanbot, you're going behind the globe. 169.2 - So when most of us think about capitalism, especially when we think about its downsides 172.68 - - long hours, low wages, miserable working conditions, child labor, unemployed Stans 177.909 - - that's what we're thinking about. Now admittedly, this is just one definition of industrial 181.59 - capitalism among many, but it's the definition we're going with. 184.65 - All right, let's go to the Thought Bubble. Industrial capitalism developed first in Britain 188.05 - in the 19th century. Britain had a bunch of advantages - it was the dominant power on 191.8 - the seas, and it was making good money off its trade with its colonies, including the 195.44 - slave trade; also, the growth of capitalism was helped by the half-century of civil unrest 200.25 - that resulted from the 17th century English Civil War. 203.26 - Now, I'm not advocating for civil wars or anything but in this particular case it was 207.799 - useful because before the war, the British crown had put a lot of regulations on the 211.849 - economy: complicated licenses, royal monopolies, etc. But during the turmoil it couldn't enforce 217.97 - them, which made for freer markets. 220.28 - Another factor was a remarkable increase in agricultural productivity in the 16th century. 224.959 - As food prices started to rise, it became profitable for farmers, both large and small, 229.629 - to invest in agricultural technologies that would improve crop yields. Those higher prices 234.519 - for grain probably resulted from population growth, which in turn was encouraged by increased 239.06 - production of food crops. 240.269 - A number of these agricultural improvements came from the Dutch, who had chronic problems 244.03 - feeding themselves, and discovered that planting different kinds of crops, like clover, that 248.12 - added nitrogen to the soil and could be used to feed livestock at the same time, meant 252.09 - that more fields could be used at once. This increased productivity, eventually brought 255.909 - down prices, and this encouraged further innovation in order to increase yield to make up for the drop in prices. 261.24 - Lower food prices had an added benefit: since food cost less and wages in England remained 265.63 - high, workers would have more disposable income, which meant that if there were consumer goods 269.54 - available, they would be consumed, which incentivized people to make consumer goods more efficiently, 274.78 - and therefore more cheaply. You can see how this positive feedback loop leads to more 278.57 - food, and more stuff, culminating in a world where people have so much stuff that we must 283.41 - rent space to store it, and so much food that obesity has become a bigger killer than starvation. 289.199 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. 290.34 - So this increased productivity also meant that fewer people needed to work in agriculture 294.419 - in order to feed the population. To put this in perspective, in 1520, 80% of the English 299.44 - population worked the land. By 1800, only 36% of adult male laborers were working in 305.669 - agriculture, and by 1850, that percentage had dropped to 25. 309.4 - This meant that when the factories started humming, there were plenty of workers to hum 312.56 - along with them. Especially child laborers. So far all this sounds pretty good, right? 319.449 - I mean, except for the child labor - who wouldn't want more, cheaper food? Yeah, well, not so fast. 325.58 - One of the ways the British achieved all this agricultural productivity was through the 328.919 - process of enclosure, whereby landlords would reclaim and privatize fields that for centuries 333.78 - had been held in common by multiple tenants. This increased agricultural productivity, 337.85 - but it also impoverished many tenant farmers, many of whom lost their livelihoods. 341.61 - Okay, for our purposes capitalism is also a cultural system, rooted in the need of private 346.35 - investors to turn a profit. So the real change needed here was a change of mind. People had 351.59 - to develop the capitalist values of taking risks and appreciating innovation. And they 356.15 - had to come to believe that making an upfront investment in something like a Stan Machine 359.94 - could pay for itself and then some. 361.569 - One of the reasons that these values developed in Britain was that the people who initially 365.36 - held them were really good at publicizing them. Writers like Thomas Mun, who worked 369.259 - for the English East India Company, exposed people to the idea that the economy was controlled 372.979 - by markets. And other writers popularized the idea that it was human nature for individuals 377.08 - to participate in markets as rational actors. 379.66 - Even our language changed: the word \"individuals\" did not apply to persons until the 17th century. 385.71 - And in the 18th century, a \"career\" still referred only to horses' racing lives. 390.02 - Perhaps the most important idea that was popularized in England was that men and women were consumers 395.5 - as well as producers and that this was actually a good thing because the desire to consume 400.47 - manufactured goods could spur economic growth. \"The main spur to trade, or rather to industry 406.22 - and ingenuity, is the exorbitant appetite of men, which they will take pain to gratify,\" 411.259 - so wrote John Cary, one of capitalism's cheerleaders, in 1695, and in talking about our appetite, 416.96 - he wasn't just talking about food. That doesn't seem radical now, but it sure did back then. 421.99 - So here in the 21st century it's clear that industrial capitalism - at least for now - has 427.15 - won. [Aside to Marx] Sorry buddy, but you know, you gave it a good run. You didn't know about Stalin. 432.139 - But capitalism isn't without its problems, or its critics, and there were certainly lots 435.93 - of shortcomings to industrial capitalism in the 19th century. Working conditions were 439.94 - awful. Days were long, arduous, and monotonous. Workers lived in conditions that people living 445.039 - in the developed world today would associate with abject poverty. One way that workers 449.069 - responded to these conditions was by organizing into labor unions. Another response was in 452.729 - many cases purely theoretical: socialism, most famously Marxian socialism. 457.11 - I should probably point out here that socialism is an imperfect opposite to capitalism, even 460.99 - though the two are often juxtaposed. Capitalism\u2019s defenders like to point out that it\u2019s \u201cnatural,\u201d 465.229 - meaning that if left to our own devices, humans would construct economic relationships that 469.56 - resemble capitalism. Socialism, at least in its modern incarnations, makes fewer pretenses 474.04 - towards being an expression of human nature; it\u2019s the result of human choice and human planning. 478.58 - So, socialism, as an intellectual construct, began in France. How\u2019d I do, Stan? Mm, in 486.0 - the border between Egypt and Libya. 488.069 - There were two branches of socialism in France, Utopian and revolutionary. Utopian socialism 492.44 - is often associated with Comte de Saint Simon and Charles Fourier, both of whom rejected 496.569 - revolutionary action after having seen the disaster of the French Revolution. 500.569 - Both were critical of capitalism and while Fourier is usually a punchline in history 503.889 - classes because he believed that, in his ideal socialist world, the seas would turn to lemonade, 508.319 - he was right that human beings have desires that go beyond basic self interest, and that 512.339 - we aren\u2019t always economically rational actors. 514.839 - The other French socialists were the revolutionaries, and they saw the French Revolution, even its 518.94 - violence, in a much more positive light. The most important of these revolutionaries was 522.55 - Auguste Blanqui, and we associate a lot of his ideas with communism, which is a term 526.86 - that he used. Like the Utopians, he criticized capitalism, but he believed that it could 530.55 - only be overthrown through violent revolution by the working classes. 534.36 - However, while Blanqui thought that the workers would come to dominate a communist world, 538.26 - he was an elitist. And he believed that workers on their own could never, on their own, overcome 541.88 - their superstitions and their prejudices in order to throw off bourgeois oppression. 546.18 - And that brings us to Karl Marx, whose ideas and beard cast a shadow over most of the 20th 551.3 - century. Oh, it\u2019s time for the Open Letter? An Open Letter to Karl Marx\u2019s Beard. 558.57 - But, first, let\u2019s see what\u2019s in the secret compartment today. Oh, robots. Stan Bots! 564.709 - Two Stan Bots, one of them female! Now I own all the means of production. You\u2019re officially 570.47 - useless to me, Stan. Now, turn the camera off. Turn the ca-- I\u2019m going to have to 574.85 - get up and turn the camera off? Stan Bot, go turn the camera off. 578.79 - Hey there, Karl Marx\u2019s beard. 580.25 - Wow, you are intense. Karl Marx, these days there are a lot of young men who think beards 585.26 - are cool. Beard lovers, if you will. Those aren\u2019t beards, those are glorified milk 588.63 - mustaches. I mean, I haven\u2019t shaved for a couple weeks, Karl Marx, but I\u2019m not claiming a beard. 591.8 - You don\u2019t get a beard by being lazy, you get a beard by being a committed revolutionary. 595.959 - That\u2019s why hardcore Marxists are literally known as \u201cBearded Marxists.\u201d These days, 601.23 - that\u2019s an insult. But you know what, Karl Marx, when I look back at history, I prefer 605.07 - the bearded communists. Let\u2019s talk about some communists who didn\u2019t have beards: 609.76 - Mao Zedong, Pol Pot, Kim Jong-il, Joseph freakin\u2019 Stalin with his face caterpillar. 614.899 - So, yeah, Karl Marx\u2019s beard, it\u2019s my great regret to inform you that there are some paltry 619.029 - beards trying to take up the class struggle these days. 622.209 - Best Wishes, John Green 623.55 - Although he\u2019s often considered the father of communism, because he co-wrote The Communist 627.1 - Manifesto, Marx was above all a philosopher and a historian. It\u2019s just that, unlike 631.45 - many philosophers and historians, he advocated for revolution. 634.86 - His greatest work, Das Kapital, sets out to explain the world of the 19th century in historical 639.31 - and philosophical terms. Marx\u2019s thinking is deep and dense and we\u2019re low on time, 643.61 - but I want to introduce one of his ideas, that of class struggle. 646.26 - So, for Marx, the focus isn\u2019t on the class, it\u2019s on the struggle. Basically Marx believed 650.43 - that classes don\u2019t only struggle to make history, but that the struggle is what makes 654.63 - classes into themselves. The idea is that through conflict, classes develop a sense 659.06 - of themselves, and without conflict, there is no such thing as class consciousness. 663.329 - So, Marx was writing in 19th century England and there were two classes that mattered: 667.29 - the workers and the capitalists. The capitalists owned most of the factors of production (in 672.18 - this case, land and the capital to invest in factories). The workers just had their 677.55 - labor. So, the class struggle here is between capitalists, who want labor at the lowest 681.49 - possible price, and the workers who want to be paid as much as possible for their work. 685.8 - There are two key ideas that underlie this theory of class struggle. First, Marx believed 689.37 - that \u201cproduction,\u201d or work, was the thing that gave life material meaning. Second, is 694.48 - that we are by nature social animals. We work together, we collaborate, we are more efficient 700.019 - when we share resources. 701.93 - Marx\u2019s criticism of capitalism is that capitalism replaces this egalitarian collaboration with 707.85 - conflict. And that means that it isn\u2019t a natural system after all. And by arguing that 712.55 - capitalism actually isn\u2019t consistent with human nature, Marx sought to empower the workers. 716.92 - That\u2019s a lot more attractive than Blanqui\u2019s elitist socialism, and while purportedly Marxist 721.57 - states like the USSR usually abandon worker empowerment pretty quickly, the idea of protecting 727.07 - our collective interest remains powerful. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll have to leave it for 730.47 - now, lest I start reading from The Communist Manifesto. 732.74 - But, ultimately socialism has not succeeded in supplanting capitalism, as its proponents 737.1 - had hoped. In the United States, at least, \u201csocialism\u201d has become something of a 740.029 - dirty word. 741.06 - So, industrial capitalism certainly seems to have won out, and in terms of material 744.63 - well-being and access to goods and services for people around the world, that\u2019s probably a good thing. 749.82 - Ugh, you keep falling over. You\u2019re a great bit, but a very flimsy one. Actually, come 753.76 - to think of it, you\u2019re more of an 8-bit. 755.38 - But how and to what extent we use socialist principles to regulate free markets remains 760.29 - an open question, and one that is answered very differently in, say, Sweden than in the 764.389 - United States. And this, I would argue, is where Marx still matters. 768.42 - Is capitalist competition natural and good, or should there be systems in place to check 772.589 - it for the sake of our collective well-being? Should we band together to provide health 776.38 - care for the sick, or pensions for the old? Should government run businesses, and if so, 780.74 - which ones? The mail delivery business? The airport security business? The education business? 785.86 - Those are the places where industrial capitalism and socialism are still competing. And in 790.079 - that sense, at least, the struggle continues. Thanks for watching, I\u2019ll see you next week. 794.089 - Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller.

Yes, perfect. 188.8 - The ordinance outlawed slavery in all five of the new states. 192.94 - Still, the Articles government was a complete disaster for exactly one reason: It could not collect taxes. 198.18 - Both the national government and the individual states had racked up massive debt to pay for the war, and their main source of revenue became tariffs, but because Congress couldn\u2019t impose them, states had to do it individually. 208.34 - And this made international trade a total nightmare, a fact worsened by the British being kinda cranky about us winning the war and therefore unwilling to trade with us. 215.5 - In 1786 and 1787, the problem got so bad in Massachusetts that farmers rose up and closed the courts to prevent them from foreclosing upon their debt-encumbered farms. 224.44 - This was called Shays\u2019 Rebellion, after Revolutionary War veteran and indebted farmer Daniel Shays. 228.64 - The uprising was quelled by the state militia, but for many, this was the sign that the Articles government, which couldn\u2019t deal with the crisis at all, had to go. 235.34 - But not for everyone; Thomas Jefferson, for instance, was a fan of Shay\u2019s Rebellion. 238.8 - \u201cA little rebellion now and then is a good thing. 241.23 - The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\u201d 246.39 - Which is all fine and good, I mean, unless you\u2019re the bleeding patriots or tyrants. 249.76 - But to most elites, Shays\u2019 Rebellion showed that too much democratic liberty among the lower classes could threaten private property. 255.38 - Also, people who held government bonds were nervous, because without tax revenue, they were unlikely to get paid back. 260.46 - And when rich people feel like something has to be done, something is usually done. 264.6 - Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 266.06 - The first attempt to do something was a meeting in Annapolis in 1786 aimed at better regulating international trade. 272.16 - Only six states sent delegates, but they agreed to meet the next year in Philadelphia to \u201crevise\u201d the Articles of Confederation. 279.04 - The delegates who met in Philly the next year had a funny definition of \u201crevision,\u201d though. 282.78 - Rather than make tweaks to the articles, they wrote a new charter of government, the Constitution, which is, with some significant alterations, the same one that Americans live under and argue about today. 292.66 - Despite what some seem to believe, the 55 men who met in Philadelphia and hammered out a new form of government were not gods, but they were far from ordinary, especially for the time. 302.14 - Most were wealthy, some very much so. 304.46 - More than half had college educations, which was super rare since .001% of Americans attended college at the time. 311.42 - About 40% had served in the army during the war. 314.44 - But, one thing they all shared was a desire for a stronger national government. 319.14 - The delegates agreed on many things: 320.86 - the government should have executive, legislative, and judicial branches; 323.93 - and should be republican, with representatives, rather than direct democracy. 327.75 - But the devil appeared in the details. 329.37 - Alexander Hamilton, probably the biggest proponent of very strong government, wanted the President and Senate to serve life terms, for example. 336.34 - That idea went nowhere because the overarching concern of almost all the delegates was to create a government that would protect against both tyranny by the government itself and tyranny by the people. 346.16 - They didn\u2019t want too much government, but they also didn\u2019t want too much democracy, which is why our Presidents are still technically elected not directly by regular people but by 538 members of the Electoral College. 356.94 - This system is so byzantine and strange that when American politicians speak of spreading democracy through the world, they never actually advocate for American-style elections. 366.42 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. 367.539 - Yes, I know, you have fantastic elections in Canada. 370.15 - Yeah, right, OK. All that too. I get it, OK? 372.87 - It\u2019s U.S. History, Thought Bubble. 374.42 - So conflicts between competing interests arose quickly at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. 378.7 - The first being between states with big populations and those with small populations. 382.78 - Large states supported James Madison\u2019s Virginia Plan, which called for a two-house legislature with representation in both proportional to a state\u2019s population. 390.56 - And smaller states, fearing that the big boys would dominate, rallied behind the New Jersey plan. 395.12 - [muttered] New Jersey. 396.02 - This called for a single legislative house with equal representation for each state, as with the Articles of Confederation. 401.4 - But, of course, coming from New Jersey, it had no chance of succeeding, and sure enough, it didn\u2019t. 405.22 - Instead we got the Great Compromise, brokered by Connecticut\u2019s Roger Sherman, which gave us two houses: 410.54 - a House of Representatives with representation proportional to each state\u2019s population, and a Senate with two members from each state. 416.36 - House members, also called Congressmen, served two year terms while Senators served six year terms, with 1/3 of them being up for election in every 2 year cycle. 423.74 - The House was designed to be responsive to the people, while the Senate was created to never pass anything and it was so masterfully designed that it still works to this day. 432.1 - However, this solution created another problem: Who should be counted in terms of representation? 436.8 - Slaveholding states wanted slaves to count toward their population, even though of course they could not vote, because they were property. 442.12 - States with few slaves argued that slaves shouldn\u2019t be counted as people because, just to be clear, none of these dudes were not racist. 448.08 - This issue was solved with the notorious 3/5ths compromise. 451.38 - For the purpose of determining the population, the total number of white people plus 3/5ths the population of \u201cother persons\u201d \u2013 the word \u201cslave\u201d was never used \u2013 would be the basis for the calculation. 461.08 - So yeah, that\u2019s still in the Constitution. 464.14 - The Constitution also contains a fugitive slave clause requiring any escaped slave to be returned to their master. 469.54 - And this meant that a slave couldn\u2019t escape slavery by moving to a state where slavery was outlawed, which meant that on some level some states couldn\u2019t enforce their own laws. 477.96 - Spoiler alert: this becomes problematic. 480.13 - But except for the tyranny of slavery, the framers really hated tyranny. 483.53 - To avoid tyranny of the government, the Constitution embraced two principles: Separation of powers and federalism. 488.36 - The government was divided into three branches \u2013 legislative, executive, and judiciary, and the Constitution incorporated checks and balances: each branch can check the power 497.96 - The legislature can make laws, but the president can veto those laws. 501.3 - The judiciary can declare laws void, too, but that\u2019s a power they had to grant themselves. 505.02 - You won\u2019t find it in the Constitution \u2013 I promise, you can look for it. 507.48 - And federalism is the idea that governmental authority rests both in the national and the state governments. 512.28 - As an American, I am a citizen both of the United States and of the state of Indiana. 516.82 - And the national government, the one set up by the Constitution, is supposed to be limited in scope to certain enumerated powers. 522.62 - Most other powers, especially the protection of health, safety and morals, are left to the states. 527.26 - But the Constitution also seeks to protect against the radicalism that too much democracy can bring. 531.8 - The mostly rich framers worried that the people, many of whom were poor and indebted, might vote in congress people, or God forbid a President, in favor of, like, redistribution of property. 541.36 - To hedge against this, senators were elected by the states, usually by state legislatures, and they were supposed to be, like, leading citizen types. 548.16 - You know, the kind of good Americans who take bribes and have adulterous affairs in airport bathrooms and patronize prostitutes and shoot Alexander Hamilton. 554.82 - Anyway, the other hedge against too much democracy is the aforementioned Electoral College, which many Americans hate because it has the potential to elect a president who did not win the popular vote, but that\u2019s kind of the point. 564.72 - The electors were supposed to be prominent, educated men of property who were better able to elect a president than, like, the rabble. 571.16 - But, the Constitution of the United States is a really impressive document, especially when you consider its longevity. 576.36 - I mean, as Crash Course World History fans will remember, the nation-state is pretty new on the historical scene, and the United States established by the Constitution, is actually one of the oldest ones. 585.1 - But the Constitution would be meaningless if it hadn\u2019t been ratified, which it was, but not without a fight that helped clarify America\u2019s political ideology. 591.72 - 9 out of the 13 states were required to ratify the Constitution in special conventions called for the purpose. 597.06 - In order to convince the delegates to vote for it, three of the framers, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of 85 essays that together are known as the Federalist Papers. 606.72 - Taken together, they\u2019re a powerful and ultimately persuasive argument for why a strong national government is necessary and ultimately not a threat to people\u2019s liberty. 615.14 - Oh, it\u2019s time for the Mystery Document? 619.38 - The rules here are simple. 620.74 - If I name the author of the Mystery Document, shock as in surprise. If I don\u2019t shock as in [gurgling noise] 624.9 - All right, Stan, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got here. 626.3 - \u201cIf circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. 643.98 - This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.\u201d 651.68 - Federalist Papers. Alexander Hamilton. [dinging noise] YES. 655.36 - Too easy, Stan, although I appreciate the opportunity for a rant. 659.32 - The whole idea of the Second Amendment was that the people could protect themselves from a standing army by being equally well-armed. 664.64 - Which, these days, would mean not that citizens should have the right to buy assault rifles, but that they should have the right to buy, like, unmanned drones. 670.38 - And arguably, suitcase nukes. 671.9 - And by the way, in the Constitution, this is not listed as a privilege, it is listed as a right. 676.16 - And, as a right, if I can\u2019t afford my own predator drone, I guess the government should buy one for me. 680.6 - It\u2019s almost as if Alexander Hamilton had no way of knowing that weaponry would one day advance past the musket. 685.52 - P.S. You know how Alexander Hamilton died? 687.561 - GUNSHOT. Sorry, I just, I had to. 689.95 - I am on a roll. 691.57 - So, it would be easy to ignore the people who opposed the Constitution because, you know, they lost. 695.77 - But some of the ideas of these so-called Anti-Federalists were particularly powerful, and they deserve a bit of attention. 700.5 - Anti-Federalists, unlike the mostly wealthy federalists, were usually supported by common people, small farmers who weren\u2019t as involved in commercial activity. 707.5 - They saw less need for a strong national government that would foster trade and protect creditors. 711.46 - And, the Anti-Federalists were very afraid of a strong government, especially one dominated by the wealthy. 716.36 - Writers like James Winthrop held that a large group of united states would be like an empire and \u201cthat no extensive empire can be governed upon Republican principles.\u201d 725.06 - As evidence, he could point to Britain, or all the way back to Rome. 728.02 - Smaller, more local governments, are more responsive to the people and better able to protect their rights. 732.32 - To the Anti-Federalists, that meant state governments. 734.68 - And while ultimately the Federalists won out and the Constitution was ratified, the issue of how large government should be did not go away. 741.47 - So, the Constitution was really only a starting point. 743.88 - It\u2019s a vague document, and the details would be worked out in the political process. 748.22 - And then on the battlefield. 749.64 - Thanks for watching.

and we've got actionable step 170.82 - that they can take away, and a quiz. 172.89 - So what is the purpose of thumbnails on YouTube? 175.62 - So pretty cool. 176.73 - It does that all for you without you having 179.16 - to look for an online course platform. 181.95 - So if that's for you, this is a great option. 184.77 - So let's take a look at another module. 186.84 - We've got designing thumbnails with Canva, 189.81 - so it's pretty accurate. 191.583 - I did experiment this myself, 193.83 - because I know the content that I created just to see 197.19 - what it had produced, and it's pretty specific. 199.41 - It's like while the recommended dimensions are 1280 pixels 202.44 - by 720 pixels, you can upsize it to this, 205.8 - you know, these dimensions. 207.18 - So it's quite specific, 208.86 - and it did pick up on some of the things. 211.38 - Some things are not as accurate, 213.36 - but for the most part it did do a pretty good job. 217.08 - And it even listed some of these things, 219.27 - making it more digestible and readable. 222.78 - Going down to conclusion and next steps, 225.54 - so you can see a recap. 227.61 - You've got encouragement to apply the learned techniques. 231.57 - So really good for e-learning. 233.43 - And if you are looking to create those types 235.2 - of e-learning online course products, 237.9 - great and perfect for your students. 240.78 - If you're happy with what you see, 243.87 - you can go and click on publish. 245.22 - Otherwise, click on edit. 246.45 - That'll take you to the editing mode 248.4 - where you can start editing some of the content. 250.89 - As you can see, we've got the cover image as well. 254.22 - Going into a module, you can take a look right here 257.4 - with the quiz as well. 259.08 - So everything can be added to that one page. 261.75 - You can also rearrange different modules 264.45 - and whether to make it viewable or not, or private. 268.62 - You can add a question too if you aren't happy 270.75 - with the auto-generated questions 272.79 - and quiz that it generated. 274.92 - But let's go ahead and click on save and preview. 277.44 - Although Courseau does create 279.0 - and help you generate an online course, 280.59 - if you do wanna publish it and obviously make it public, 283.26 - then you are going to have to upgrade. 285.84 - So to make the course public, embed or share, 288.3 - please upgrade your account. 289.8 - So speaking of plans and pricing, let's head there. 292.98 - And this is what it starts at. 295.32 - Based on a mini+ plan, we've got $39 per month. 299.49 - You can create 10 mini courses per month 302.46 - and some of these other benefits. 304.44 - But that's Courseau, if you do like the functionality 306.57 - and what it produces, then feel free to use Courseau. 309.78 - If that means for you to get your course out there 313.14 - and start selling it, why not? 314.55 - And once you do have that link 316.74 - to share your online course, you can simply plug 319.29 - that into your online selling platform such as Gumroad, 323.145 - Payhip, or if you want some alternates, 326.01 - feel free to look in the description box below 327.75 - where I've got a list of or a set of videos 331.35 - where I share some platforms, 332.91 - where you can sell your digital products, 335.25 - and in this case, online courses. 337.74 - Okay, the next way to generate an online course 340.71 - is one that's relatively new. 342.39 - This one's called LearningStudioAI. 345.12 - And with this, right off the bat, you can enter a subject, 348.24 - and I did sign up already, so it will actually create it 352.23 - and put it into my online course library. 354.9 - But to give you an example of what it can produce 357.12 - after entering a subject, take a look at this. 360.45 - This one, I simply prompted it to create an online course 363.66 - based on artificial intelligence. 365.31 - It's created the topic and a subheading here, 368.91 - master the principles and applications of AI. 371.73 - It's got an overview, it's laid it out 373.68 - in this kind of blog article format, as you can see. 379.41 - So it goes on pretty in depth and even goes down to a quiz. 384.36 - So it's not so much this online course curriculum format 388.2 - that you saw, like in Courseau, 391.2 - it's rather this kind of logical step sequence, right? 395.49 - One goes through and reads through, 397.68 - they can preview it without the editing mode, 400.92 - but if you do want to share it, you can. 402.9 - Simply copy the link at the moment. 405.69 - You know, when you sign up, you do get a seven-day trial. 408.99 - If you like, of course, what you see, how it works, 412.23 - how it functions, and yeah, use Learning Studio. 415.14 - But let's go ahead. 415.973 - I'm gonna share, and you can see, copy the link. 419.13 - There are other ways of course to share, 421.05 - but this is what a student sees. 423.0 - They see the course, they can sign up, 425.64 - create their own online course. 426.933 - They can share and download. 428.79 - Apart from sharing, they can download the PDF version. 432.24 - So you can see right here. 433.8 - In your account, these are where the online courses sit. 436.77 - So you can take a look at another example 438.66 - that are callisthenics mastery going there. 441.84 - You can take a look at some of the examples here. 444.33 - So this one's more related to training 447.06 - and of course, exercise. 449.76 - Let's go ahead and experiment with a another course topic. 453.57 - This time I'm going to put in leadership skills 455.46 - for entrepreneurs and click on create course. 458.34 - Okay, the course has generated. 459.69 - It took about two minutes. 461.01 - In this case, we've got leadership skills 462.96 - for entrepreneurs, a stock image I presume, 466.17 - and a subheading, as well as an overview 469.86 - and some of the modules. 471.72 - And this bar does appear at the top that it's made up. 476.13 - You will be in the editing mode. 477.78 - So this means that you can edit anything you want. 481.2 - And if you don't want to put entrepreneurs, 484.47 - it can be, you know, for small business owners 486.69 - or whatnot, you can type away, edit away the image. 491.43 - You can edit right here. 493.5 - There is a setting at the top 495.54 - where you can change the theme colour as well 497.79 - to one of these other ones. 498.87 - Let's choose blue. 500.16 - And do I wanna show the Learning StudioAI logo? 503.7 - Of course, this is a paid tool, 505.74 - so you can take it away if you do not want it. 509.94 - It's usually there on the bottom anyway, 511.44 - but just going through some of the content right here, 515.19 - you can see some of the other things you can edit. 517.98 - What's also interesting is that 519.27 - it's put together this practical exercise 521.7 - that one or your student can take a look at 525.12 - some of the exercises include self-assessment, 528.27 - complete a self-assessment questionnaire, 531.12 - analyse real-world case studies. 533.22 - So some action steps, I guess. 535.53 - A couple of other notable features 537.24 - in the editing mode include being able to insert an image 540.72 - or a video in between a lesson or some text. 544.11 - So I've got paste in a video where you can upload your own, 547.35 - or an image right here. 549.63 - Let's say you do want to add an image, 551.37 - you can click on the image icon 553.35 - and search for a royalty-free image. 556.14 - So something like technology, which are very searched for, 559.05 - will bring up these results. 560.85 - And if I click on this one right here, it's uploading now. 564.78 - And there we go. 565.613 - We've got the image, and then the text continues. 569.1 - As I mentioned, you can share the course right away 571.86 - by clicking on copy link, and people will see a version 575.46 - that's obviously non-editable. 577.35 - Otherwise you can download it, 579.03 - and that'll generate a PDF version. 581.34 - And here's the PDF version of the online course I generated. 586.32 - So it looks pretty consistent 588.3 - with the one generated by Learning StudioAI. 592.093 - And finally, the next tool that you can use 593.61 - to generate an online course is from Mini Course. 597.03 - This one's quite established. 598.89 - I've seen them around, I've seen some of the ads. 601.38 - And here's how it works. 602.82 - All right, so you can get started. 604.95 - The pricing involves $0, that's for the basic plan, 609.66 - and you can create up to three mini courses. 613.17 - As with all software and tools, on its free plan, 615.66 - usually there are limitations, 617.01 - and you can compare the difference 618.57 - with the basic, premium and premium plus right here. 621.18 - But let me show you how it works. 622.74 - I did generate one called maximising your reach, 625.98 - and it's probably best to show you 628.17 - what it looks like and what it generated. 630.24 - They call these things cards. 631.71 - So each card does have a topic 634.38 - and things such as an introduction. 636.66 - We've got a definition of social media benefits. 639.78 - It goes on, and you can edit each individual one, 642.75 - adding an image or a video to each. 645.09 - You can add lessons in between by clicking on the plus, 648.06 - and then you can choose from one of the options, 650.58 - things such as information, or you can let AI assist you. 654.87 - There are multiple choice options as well, 657.54 - as well as feedback. 659.16 - So it's quite advanced, quite flexible, if you're looking 661.86 - for a tool that can add these kinds of elements. 665.88 - But before we do all of that, 667.23 - let's go and create a mini-course, 669.12 - so I can show you the process. 671.04 - On this page, you'll be given a number of options 673.53 - to create your mini-course, 674.73 - the first being use AI assistant. 677.16 - Now, if you are on a free plan, you can't so much use this. 680.25 - You can try to out the first time with your first course, 683.13 - but that's what I did, at least, with the first course. 686.1 - Otherwise, you can start from scratch 687.66 - and add your content to the cards, 691.32 - or you can use use-case ideas. 694.59 - Let's say you do wanna create from scratch. 696.15 - You can click that and then enter the name of your course. 699.42 - Let's just name it basics of Instagram. 702.48 - And then you begin adding your content, 704.94 - your image, the actual content. 707.13 - And then once you've added all the cards, all the lessons 709.74 - for your mini-course, it will look, 711.51 - obviously, not like this, 713.331 - but this one was auto-generated using AI. 716.73 - There are a few other options here, like this AI assistant. 720.36 - We've got complete the rest, correct the grammar, 722.91 - you can summarise, so it's built in. 725.07 - It's got this built in AI assistant to assist you 728.01 - with your online course creation. 729.69 - You can change a theme by going to theme 732.03 - and then choosing from one of the themes 734.43 - that they have right here. 736.29 - This isn't what students will see, obviously, 738.57 - if you click on view, that will take you 740.43 - to a preview of what your course looks like. 743.278 - This is the start of it, so maximising your reach, 745.59 - and we can see what it is. 748.11 - And clicking on the next button, 750.21 - we'll see the first modules, 752.16 - the first lesson here, and clicking on next. 755.52 - So it kind of works like a presentation slide. 758.16 - And those are three tools that you can use to quickly 760.65 - and easily create your online course. 762.84 - Each of the tools have its pros and cons, 765.39 - its perks and some disadvantages too, 768.15 - as you saw in this video. 769.41 - So feel free to pick and choose which one is best suited 772.83 - for you and your goals. 775.14 - But hopefully this video was helpful 776.7 - in your online course creation. 778.5 - If you do wanna learn which platforms to use 780.78 - to start selling your online course, 782.49 - I do have several videos. 784.17 - So the ones I'll recommend is right here and here. 786.78 - So I'll see you in those videos."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Creating Online Courses with AI 0:18 -

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.1 - Hello, I'm Hank Green and I want to teach you chemistry. 2.98 - But please, do not run away screaming. 5.009 - If you give me five minutes to try to convince you that chemistry is not torture, 9.32 - but instead the amazing and beautiful science of stuff, 13.16 - and if you give it a chance it will not only blow your mind but also give you a deeper understanding of your world. 18.98 - This is just my opinion here, 20.55 - but I think that understanding the world leads to greater ability to enjoy the world 24.07 - and there's nothing that helps you understand the world better than chemistry. 28.07 - Chemistry holds the secrets to how life first formed, how cancers are cured, 32.369 - how iPhones have bigger hard drives than 5 year old laptops, 36.58 - and how life on this planet might just be able to continue thriving, even ours, if we play our cards right. 43.88 - Chemistry is the science of how three tiny particles, the proton, the neutron, and the electron, 48.96 - came together in trillions of combinations to form, get this, everything. 55.18 - Now chemistry is a peculiar science, 57.0 - sometimes talked about as a bridge between the ultra abstract world of particle physics 61.219 - and the more visible sciences like biology. 63.92 - But calling chemistry a bridge is like calling Eurasia an island. 68.42 - Chemistry has it all, mad scientists, world changing revelations, the practical, the impractical, 74.32 - medicine, bombs, food, beauty, destruction, life and death, answers to questions you never knew you had. 80.74 - I love chemistry, and I hope I can give you a glimpse into why. 85.47 - So today, let's start out with maybe the biggest idea of all time, and move on from there: 91.21 - stuff is made from atoms. 94.66 - [Theme Music] 104.14 - I know, you aren't shocked, you aren't awed, you might not even be paying attention any more, 109.5 - but when atomic theory was first proposed, it sounded pretty crazy. 113.68 - And yes, we call it 'Atomic Theory', using the scientific definition of theory, 118.32 - which is \"a well-tested set of ideas that explains many disparate observations\", 122.56 - not the colloquial definition of theory, which is \"a guess.\" 125.66 - But luckily there's no-one running around any more saying \"atoms are just a theory.\" 129.54 - But it wasn't that long ago that people were running around saying that. 132.34 - You wanna know who settled it for good? Einstein! 135.86 - Atoms had been postulated for a long time by the 20th century, 139.099 - but it wasn't until Einstein mathematically proved the existence of atoms and molecules in 1905 145.1 - that the matter was truly settled. 146.84 - And you thought Einstein was all about relativity and E=mc2, he also proved atoms exist! 152.42 - Here's how it happened: 153.86 - In 1827, a botanist named Robert Brown was looking at pollen grains in water through a microscope 159.16 - and he noticed that they jiggled randomly even when there was no movement to cause the jiggling. 164.96 - It was a mystery for a long time. 167.52 - Until 1905 when Einstein theorized that this phenomenon was caused by 171.67 - as-yet-unproven atomic particles actually smacking into the grains of pollen. 176.89 - He wrote up some fancy math, showing that his theory predicted this motion almost perfectly, 182.19 - and everyone had to concede that yes, tiny discrete bits of matter were indeed smacking into the pollen, 188.9 - and thus molecules, and by extension atoms, must exist. 192.92 - Today, we remember this botanist and his discovery by calling the motion he observed Brownian motion. 198.86 - It's kinda crazy that every physical thing you've ever interacted with is made up of little ball thingies. 205.42 - It started with people wondering what would happen if you just kept slicing something in half forever. 210.2 - Eventually, and of course it turns out that there's no knife sharp enough to do this, 213.489 - you end up with one, pure, unbreakable bit of that substance. 217.009 - The word \"atom\", indeed, is from the Greek for \"indivisible\", 220.279 - though, of course, as we learned in World War II, atoms can be broken as well. 225.379 - So all the stuff that we think of as stuff is made of atoms, tiny discrete particles that have specific properties, 230.8 - depending on the arrangement of three simple subatomic particles. 234.82 - There's the proton, heavy and positively charged, the neutron, about the same size as the proton but neutral, 241.22 - and the electron, which has the same amount of charge as the proton, just opposite, 245.8 - and very nearly has no mass at all, about 1800 times less massive than the proton or neutron. 251.16 - Protons and neutrons hang out in the nucleus, and thus are the nuclear components or nucleons; 256.02 - electrons hang out around the nucleus and are the parts of the atom that do all the interesting chemical stuff. 260.76 - But before we get to the chemistry of the electrons, we first have got to understand the properties of the nucleus. 266.56 - Okay, this is pretty important, so pay attention here. 268.83 - The number of protons in an atom determines what element it is. 273.05 - 79 protons: always gold. 59 protons: always praseodymium. 278.78 - The number of protons in an element is its atomic number. 281.66 - It sits right on top of the box in the periodic table because that is the element's defining trait. 285.94 - So an atom of silver with 47 protons in its nucleus is always an atom of silver. 291.0 - Depending on what its electrons are doing and what it's bonded to, 293.78 - it might be part of a chemical that's silver-colored or black or blue or shiny or poisonous or a cure for disease, 299.8 - but whatever it is, that atom is still silver and will remain an atom of silver probably forever, 306.04 - because that core number is very, very difficult to change. 309.2 - Now you might have noticed something weird about silver here: 311.72 - it's chemical symbol, the one- or two-letter short code that tells you what it is, is Ag, 317.21 - not Si, which is silicon, or Sv which is perfectly available, but Ag. Why? To torture you? No. 326.16 - Silver, of course, because we've known about it for a long time, was one of the first elements added to the periodic table, 331.19 - and back then it was called \"argentum\", Latin for \"shiny gray stuff.\" 335.81 - Also, the root of the word \"Argentina\", 338.49 - where Spanish explorers heard rumors of mountains made of silver, which of course did not exist. 343.79 - The name \"Argentina\", just like the chemical symbol \"Ag\", stuck, 348.13 - despite neither of them being particularly representative of reality. Now, back to science. 353.35 - Nuclei, which is the plural of nucleus, are boring. 356.37 - They're thousands of times smaller than the atom as a whole, 358.94 - and they mostly just sit around being exactly the same as they were when they were first 363.26 - created billions of years ago, 365.12 - held together by the strongest of the four fundamental forces of physics, the strong nuclear force. 369.96 - The fact that nuclei are so boring is the very reason they're the defining characteristic of elements. 374.44 - While electrons can jump from atom to atom whenever it's convenient, 377.56 - the number of protons is almost always extremely stable. 380.96 - So that core of the atom, the nucleus, always comes out of chemical reactions unscathed. 385.52 - It's the bit that we can bump around from reaction to reaction, 388.5 - but always remains pure and behaves the same way as any other atom with that number of protons. 393.32 - The atomic number is the soul of the atom. It's what makes it it. 397.6 - Neutrons are important too, of course, in their own way, but they don't change what element an atom is. 402.94 - One of the two keys to all things chemical is charge, we'll discuss that in another episode, 408.04 - and since neutrons don't have any charge, they mostly don't change the properties of an atom. 411.98 - But they are, nonetheless, vital. 413.9 - We all know that like charges repel each other. Neutrons serve as a kind of buffer between the protons. 419.22 - You couldn't pack silver's 47 protons together in the nucleus by themselves. 423.46 - They couldn't handle it; they'd rip themselves apart. 426.01 - So nuclei only clump together permanently when the right number of protons and neutrons get together. 431.13 - Silver needs about 60 neutrons to space out the 47 protons correctly. But it doesn't have to be 60. 437.17 - In fact, silver nuclei are also very stable with 62 neutrons. 440.61 - 61 though, that doesn't work, and the reasons for that, I don't know, you would have to talk to a nuclear physicist. 447.04 - The atomic number of silver doesn't change as the number of neutrons changes 450.83 - because the number of protons stays the same. 453.36 - But the relative atomic mass does change. 456.06 - Relative atomic mass, which used to be called atomic weight back when I was in school, 459.78 - is basically the number of protons plus the number of neutrons averaged across all the silver on Earth. 465.0 - Because silver has two different stable isotopes, each with a different number of neutrons, 469.52 - its relative atomic mass ends up not being a whole number. 472.58 - About 52% of silver has 60 neutrons and about 48% has 62. 477.52 - The relative atomic mass, then, ends up being about halfway between 107 and 109, 107.8682. 484.5 - You'll note that I said these two different sorts of silver are called isotopes, 488.04 - they have different masses but the same chemical properties, 490.96 - and are the same element and so belong in the same place on the periodic table. 495.13 - In fact, the word \"isotope\" means \"same place\". 498.36 - And different isotopes have different mass numbers. 501.06 - The mass number is just the total number of nucleons in the nucleus, which is different from atomic mass. 506.66 - It's simple addition for a single atom, rather than an average of all the relative atomic masses of all the silver atoms on Earth. 513.34 - So silver has two stable isotopes, one with a mass number of 107, which we'd call silver-107, 519.24 - and one with a mass number of 109, silver-109. 522.54 - There's an easy way to write all this out, of course, to keep your information straight. 525.72 - The chemical symbol, with the atomic number or number of protons here, 529.249 - the mass number, or number of protons and neutrons here, 532.629 - and the charge out here, which tells you by simple addition or subtraction how many electrons there are. 537.94 - Finally, before we conclude this first episode of Crash Course Chemistry, 541.72 - and thus, our discussion of the atomic nucleus, a note on the pronunciation of \"nucleus\". 547.28 - You are welcome to say \"nuculus\", it is an accepted pronunciation of that word, 551.22 - but if you can find it in you, it's probably best to switch over to \"nucleus\", which is, after all, how it's spelled. 557.22 - And that is all for today's episode of Crash Course Chemistry, if you were paying attention, you now know: 561.56 - More about atoms than anyone did in 1900, 565.02 - like that they were finally confirmed when Einstein mathematically defined Brownian motion; 569.08 - That elements are chemically pure substances, 571.56 - and the type of element an atom is is defined by how many protons it has in its nucleus, or its atomic number; 578.14 - That neutrons stabilize nuclei for their proton friends; 581.52 - That different isotopes of the same element are the reason relative atomic masses are never whole numbers; 586.58 - and you know that nuclei are the uninteresting, boring bits of the atom, 590.82 - and the electrons are where all the interesting chemical-ly stuff happens. 594.66 - Crash Course Chemistry is filmed, edited, and directed by Nick Jenkins, 597.889 - Dr. Heiko Langner is our Chemistry consultant, sound design is done by Michael Aranda, 602.709 - and our graphics team is Thought Bubble. 604.7 - If you have any questions, comments, or ideas on any of this stuff we will endeavor to answer 607.999 - them in the comments below. 609.41 - Thank you for watching Crash Course Chemistry."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:10 - Introduction: Chemistry and the Science of Stuff 0:55 - The Beauty and Utility of Chemistry 1:48 - Atoms: The Building Blocks of Everything 3:10 - Einstein's Proof of Atoms and Brownian Motion 5:23 - The Subatomic World: Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons 7:10 - Atomic Number and Element Identity 8:55 - Isotopes and Mass Numbers 10:43 - Writing Atomic Information and Nuclear Stability"}]}

The international banking system is an enigma. 3.94 - There are more than 30.000 different banks world wide, and they hold unbelievable amounts of assets. 10.02 - The top 10 banks alone account for roughly 25 trillion US-Dollars. 15.334 - Today, banking can seem very complex, but originally, the idea was to make life simpler. 27.902 - 11th century Italy was the centre of European trading. 31.582 - Merchants from all over the continent met to trade their goods, but there was one problem: 36.657 - too many currencies in circulation. 39.155 - In Pisa, merchants had to deal with seven different types of coins 43.515 - and had to exchange their money constantly. 46.3 - This exchange business, which commonly took place outdoors benches, 50.44 - is where we get the word \"bank\" from; 52.6 - from the word \"banco\", Italian for \"bench\". 55.56 - The dangers of travelling, counterfeit money and the difficulty of getting a loan got people thinking. 61.84 - It was time for a new business model: 64.3 - home brokers started to give credit to businessmen, 67.04 - while genevese merchants developed cashless payments. 70.06 - Networks of banks spread all over Europe, 73.058 - handing out credit even to the church, or European kings. 77.22 - What about today ? 78.38 - In a nutshell, banks are in the risk management business. 81.995 - This is a simplified version of the way it works. 85.195 - People keep their money in banks and receive a small amout of interest. 89.293 - The bank takes this money, and lends it out at much higher interest rates. 94.015 - It's a calculated risk, because some of the lenders will default on their credit. 98.877 - This process is essential for our economic system, 101.779 - because it provides ressources for people to buy things like houses, 105.419 - or for industries to expand their businesses and grow. 109.257 - So banks take funds that are unused by savers, 112.32 - and turn them into funds society can use to do stuff. 115.76 - Other sources of income for banks include accepting saving deposits, 119.66 - the credit card business, 120.88 - buying and selling currencies, 122.62 - custodian business 123.96 - and cash management services. 126.2 - The main problem with banks nowadays is, 128.46 - that a lot of them have abandoned their traditional role as providers of long-time financial products, 133.851 - in favour of short-time gains that carry much higher risks. 137.74 - During the financial boom, most major banks adopted financial constructs 142.27 - that were barely comprehensable 144.117 - and did their own trading in habit to make fast money, 146.86 - and earn their executives and traders millions in bonuses. 150.62 - This was nothing short of gambling and damaged whole economies and societies. 155.54 - Like back in 2008, 157.32 - when banks like Leeman Brothers gave credit to basically anyone who wanted to buy a house, 162.127 - and thereby put the bank in an extremely dangerous risk position. 165.718 - This led to the collapse of the housing market in the US and parts of Europe, 169.42 - causing stock prices to plummet, which eventually led to a global banking crisis, 174.04 - and one of the largest financial crises in history. 177.66 - Hundreds of billions of dollars just evaporated. 181.34 - Millions of people lost their jobs and lots of money. 184.86 - Most of the world's major banks had to pay billions in fines 188.32 - and bankers became some of the least trusted professionals. 191.68 - The US government and the European Union had to put together huge bailout packages 195.8 - to purchase bad assets and stop the banks from going bankrupt. 199.774 - New regulations were put into force to govern the banking business, 203.114 - compulsary bank emergency funds were enforced to absorb shocks in the event of another financial crisis. 209.26 - But other pieces of tough new legislation were successfully blocked by the banking lobby. 214.563 - Today, other models of providing financing are gaining ground fast. 218.48 - Like new investment banks, that charge a yearly fee 221.7 - and do not get commissions on sales, thus providing the motivation to act in the motivation in the best interests of their clients. 228.154 - or credit unions - cooperative initiatives that were established in the 19th century 232.76 - to circumvent credit sharks. 234.76 - In a nutshell, they provide the same financial services as banks, 238.58 - but focus on shared value rather than profit maximisation. 242.76 - The self proclaimed goal is to help members create opportunities like starting small businesses, 248.496 - expanding farms or building family homes 251.38 - while investing back into communities. 253.72 - They are controlled by their members, who also elect the board of directors democratically. 258.875 - World wide, credit union systems vary significantly, 262.435 - ranging from a handfull of members 264.094 - to organisations with several billion US-Dollars 267.075 - and hundreds of thousands of members. 269.06 - The focus on benefits for their members impacts the risk credit unions are willing to take, 274.115 - which explains why credit unions, although also hurting, 277.6 - survived the last financial crisis way better than traditional banks. 282.52 - Not to forget the explosion of crowdfunding in recent years. 285.82 - Aside from making awesome video games possible, 288.76 - platforms arosed that enabled people to get loans from large groups of small investors, 293.274 - circumventing the bank as a middle man. 295.394 - But it also works for industry - 297.234 - lots of new technology companies started out on kickstarter or indiegogo. 301.535 - The funding individual gets the satisfaction of being part of a bigger thing, 305.396 - and can invest in ideas they believe in. 307.76 - While spreading the risk so widely, that, if the project fails, the damage is limited. 312.44 - And last but not least, micro credits. 314.782 - Lots of very small loans, mostly handed out in developping countries that help people escape poverty. 320.342 - People who were previously unable to get access to the money they needed to start a business, 324.822 - because they weren't deemed worth the time. 327.42 - Nowadays, the granting of micro-credits has evolved into a multi-billion dollar business. 332.34 - So, banking might not be up your street, but the banks' role of providing funds to people and businesses 338.599 - is crucial for our society and has to be done. 341.28 - Who will do it and how it will be done in the future is up for us to decide, though."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

in this video I'm going to show you how 1.68 - to successfully Market an online course 3.76 - from start to finish this is a complete 6.12 - lesson in online course marketing and 8.24 - I'm going to show you how to do it in a 9.519 - way that's ethical not pushy or Shady 12.16 - like some of the things you might have 13.16 - seen online not naming any names I've 15.559 - had the privilege of working with some 16.92 - of the most successful online course 18.279 - creators out there including teachable J 20.6 - shett Susie Moore Melissa Griffin 22.519 - Caitlyn Batcher and many more helping 24.64 - them with their Facebook ads and also 26.519 - their online course marketing strategy 28.56 - and what I'm going to show you in this 29.72 - video are the core principles and 31.32 - strategies that people and companies 33.04 - like them use to sell online courses 36.12 - really really successfully so let's get 38.559 - straight into it the first thing to 40.879 - understand is what people actually need 43.32 - before they'll be willing to buy from 45.0 - you and there are four key things the 47.079 - first thing is they need to actually 49.36 - know they have a problem and be looking 51.719 - for a solution for it sounds kind of 53.32 - obvious but there's no point targeting 55.32 - your marketing towards people who don't 57.28 - even know that the problem you're trying 59.12 - to solve exists or that they're 60.6 - suffering from it and therefore are not 62.359 - looking for a solution for it the second 64.199 - thing is they need to see you as an 66.08 - expert in the field they need to see you 68.28 - as somebody who is actually able to 70.439 - solve their problem the third thing is 72.159 - they need to trust you so not only do 74.04 - they need to see you as an expert but 76.08 - they need to trust you there needs to be 77.84 - a relationship there where they see you 80.2 - as somebody they would be happy to 81.92 - actually give money to in exchange for a 83.68 - solution to their problem and fourth 85.88 - they need to see that you have the 88.4 - solution that they need to solve their 90.68 - problem right now that's essentially 92.759 - your offer or your course they need to 94.72 - understand that that is exactly what 96.28 - they need to solve the big problem that 98.36 - they're experiencing right now now then 100.799 - once you establish those things and they 102.36 - know that you've got the solution 103.52 - they're probably going to have some 105.04 - objections and you're going to need to 106.92 - overcome those objections so objections 108.96 - are reasons why they aren't willing to 111.96 - buy your course right away it could be 114.0 - something like they're not sure if 115.119 - they're at the right stage in business 116.64 - just yet to apply the materials and get 118.92 - the most value out of your course or it 120.759 - could be a myriad of other reasons 122.52 - depending on your audience and your 124.0 - course now you need to be able to 125.88 - overcome those objections and the sale 128.28 - is right over that hill now the reason 130.44 - I'm telling you this is because people 132.0 - need to go through that entire Journey 134.2 - before they're going to be willing to 135.48 - hand over their credit card and buy your 137.519 - course and that's where so many people 139.4 - go wrong they build a great course they 141.36 - build out a sales page they put it up on 143.239 - their website and then they start 144.599 - sending people there from social media 146.28 - from their email list and wherever they 147.8 - can but after a while no body he buys 150.8 - and they wonder why and it's because you 153.0 - can't simply take strangers or people 154.8 - who barely know you send them to a sales 157.04 - page and ask them to give you money they 159.2 - need to go on this journey of 161.08 - establishing you as the expert building 163.48 - trust building that relationship and 166.04 - then pitching them with your product or 168.08 - service before they're actually ever 170.159 - going to give you a scent and by 172.04 - shortcutting that process you end up 174.08 - with a course that sits there Gathering 176.12 - dust because no one's buying it now the 178.239 - great news is you can automate this 180.68 - journey okay and that is what I'm going 182.519 - to show you now we call this automated 184.84 - sales process a sales funnel or a sales 187.799 - process now there are lots of different 189.84 - types of sales funnels out there but all 192.2 - of them contain the same core steps 194.4 - essentially at step number one you're 196.239 - going to take a new lead and collect 198.48 - their email address after that you'll 200.92 - follow up with more valuable content 202.72 - insights and continue to build that 204.48 - trust and relationship next you'll pitch 206.879 - your offer for your online course or 208.72 - coaching and then finally you address 210.64 - those key objections so what I'm going 212.2 - to do right now is share my two favorite 214.64 - types of sales funnels for marketing 216.519 - online courses one of them is great for 218.64 - more expensive courses like $500 and up 221.28 - and the other one works really well for 223.08 - courses that are priced below $500 now 225.799 - the reason we use different sales 227.28 - funnels for different price points is 229.2 - because more expensive online courses 231.519 - obviously take more nurturing and it 233.12 - takes more to build enough trust in 235.159 - order for somebody to buy a course 236.56 - that's let's say $1,000 compared to a 239.36 - lower value cost like let's say $50 you 241.959 - don't need to go through as much trust 244.319 - building in order to convince somebody 246.84 - that they should buy your $50 course you 249.04 - can think about it the same way as what 250.599 - it takes for somebody to buy a car for 253.0 - $40,000 versus the decision-making 255.4 - process uh when they get to the checkout 257.479 - at the supermarket and they buy that $2 259.359 - chocolate bar the decision-making 261.28 - process and the level of thought that 263.0 - goes into that is obviously much less 265.88 - all right let's get into the first 267.04 - method and that is the webinar so this 269.36 - is essentially an online video training 271.56 - where you pitch your product at the end 274.12 - so what you do is you create either a 276.4 - live training or a recorded video 278.8 - training that's about an hour long where 280.759 - you go through and actually give value 282.96 - and solve a small problem that your 284.56 - audience have at the end of that 286.96 - training which is about 45 minutes you 288.88 - spend about 15 minutes pitching your 291.32 - online course or your coaching program 293.84 - and now the key here is your teaching on 295.68 - a topic that is something that your 297.68 - audience really wants to learn about and 299.24 - during that process you're solving a 300.639 - small problem that your audience has 302.44 - that is also related to the big problem 305.039 - that your course is going to solve 307.0 - because you want to draw people in who 308.28 - are going to be interested in your 309.56 - online course and they need to solve 311.32 - that problem that your course solves but 313.039 - you don't want to solve it in the online 314.6 - training because then they're not going 316.28 - to want to buy you a course so you want 317.72 - to help them in the training you want to 319.28 - solve a small problem and then you want 321.4 - to be able to lead into a pitch to sell 323.4 - them into your online course at the end 326.0 - now there are lots of different ways to 327.72 - structure a webinar and I could 329.12 - literally do an hourong YouTube video on 331.8 - how to create a great webinar so I can't 333.479 - do all of that in this video but if you 335.319 - do some searching around you will see 336.72 - some great resources on how to create a 339.8 - webinar in terms of the slides and the 341.479 - structure and all that good stuff now to 343.28 - actually set this up I use a tool called 345.479 - easy webinar which allows you to host 348.28 - the live or the Evergreen webinars 350.6 - meaning the pre-recorded webinars and 352.6 - this tool allows you to set up every 354.72 - aspect of your webinar makes it really 356.919 - easy and I'll include a link to that in 358.6 - the description below if if you want to 359.96 - check it out now once you've created 362.12 - your webinar you need to then create a 364.4 - web page or a landing page that allows 366.8 - people to sign up for it so people go to 369.08 - the landing page they enter their name 370.479 - and email and they register for your 372.639 - live or your recorded webinar once they 375.88 - sign up they'll be able to attend watch 377.8 - the training and they will see your 379.039 - pitch at the end so now you're going to 381.24 - be collecting email addresses when 382.96 - people sign up for your free webinar 384.479 - which is the first step in our sales 386.52 - funnel on the webinar you're going to be 388.72 - teaching them some really valuable 390.039 - information which is going to position 392.08 - you as the go-to expert or authority in 394.56 - your space and it's also going to be 396.44 - establishing that trust and the beauty 398.16 - of video is that seeing you on camera 400.319 - actually helps establish that trust much 402.52 - faster than let's say email only and 404.88 - when you pitch on the webinar you're 406.12 - explaining to them why your solution is 408.199 - something they need right now and you 409.759 - can also address those common objections 412.0 - right there on the webinar as well so 413.759 - you can see by using a webinar we can 416.44 - actually fit all of those things we 417.919 - mentioned at the start of the video into 420.199 - a the space of one hour so we can 422.36 - compress that Journey down into the 424.479 - space of just one hour but it doesn't 426.919 - end there after the webinar you'll 428.759 - actually want to send a series of emails 431.199 - out in order to continue this journey so 434.56 - the emails you want to send after a 436.039 - webinar are number one the webinar 437.879 - replay email so you need to send an 440.56 - email to everybody who registers for the 442.36 - webinar after the webinar ends that 444.599 - tells them that the replay is available 446.8 - because attendance is key the more 448.919 - people that actually sign up for and 451.28 - then watch your webinar the more sales 454.08 - you will get of your course so having a 456.72 - replay and you can automate this in Easy 458.84 - webinar and sending an email out that 461.24 - tells them the replay is available after 463.039 - the webinar means that more people are 465.12 - going to actually watch it if they 466.8 - didn't make the live or the first uh 469.36 - viewing of the recorded webinar in email 472.28 - number two which you would send the next 473.8 - day you want to paint a picture of what 476.599 - life is going to look like if they don't 478.919 - solve their problem right away so paint 481.68 - that picture of what things are going to 483.159 - look like if they continue on as they 485.08 - are without bothering to solve the 487.36 - problem at the end of that email you're 489.12 - going to reiterate your offer and your 491.199 - course on the next day you're going to 493.52 - send the third email which is going to 495.319 - be future pacing this is going to paint 498.039 - a picture of what life will look like if 500.44 - they actually go through your course and 502.479 - solve that problem so what is life going 505.24 - to be like once they get rid of this big 508.639 - problem or big pain point that they 510.52 - experience the best thing you can do 512.399 - here is paint that picture using an 514.719 - example of a past student or even of 517.0 - yourself and demonstrating what life 519.36 - looked like before and now what it looks 521.279 - like after you've gone through and fix 523.36 - the problem in email number four you 525.519 - really want to address objections and 527.2 - one of the best ways to address 528.88 - objections is to use your testimonials 531.519 - or case studies from past students or 534.08 - clients so if you can identify the core 537.16 - objections that your potential customers 538.92 - have and then find testimonials or case 542.04 - studies that specifically speak to or 545.279 - address these objections then that is 548.24 - the most powerful way you can actually 550.88 - squash those objections email number 553.56 - five FAQ so frequently ask questions I 556.72 - like to send out an email that addresses 558.959 - most of the questions that people have 560.56 - around the course like how long will I 562.399 - have access for do I have direct access 564.92 - to you and all of those things that 566.68 - people like to ask before they join it's 568.92 - surprising ing how often one simple 572.399 - question can hold people back from 574.519 - jumping in and joining the course and if 576.76 - you can just answer that one question 578.56 - for them then boom you'll get a sale and 581.6 - finally i' like to send one more email 583.24 - on the last day with just a final notice 585.68 - again reiterating the offer explaining 588.2 - how it's going to help them what life 590.079 - will look like afterwards and why they 591.839 - should join so that is how you Market 595.12 - your online course using a webinar sales 597.56 - funnel now if you've got a call that's 599.8 - priced a little lower let's say $500 or 602.04 - below you might want to use this second 604.68 - online course Marketing sales funnel 606.92 - which is a simple email sequence so 609.839 - unlike the webinar where you have to 611.399 - have a live or pre-recorded video 613.519 - training an email sequence works like 616.24 - this the first thing to do is offer them 618.0 - something of value for free in exchange 620.76 - for an email address speaking of value 623.079 - if you finding this video helpful and 624.72 - you haven't done it already make sure 626.24 - you smash that like button okay now the 628.079 - thing of value that you can offer for 630.16 - your potential customers could be a 631.839 - cheat sheet a checklist a case study or 635.079 - maybe even a swipe file for example 637.6 - something that I could offer for free to 639.36 - my audience who are interested in 640.839 - Facebook ads is a checklist for iOS 644.44 - 14.5 and how to overcome the Privacy 647.519 - changes that came with that people are 649.2 - really interested in that topic at the 650.76 - moment and they would be really Keen to 652.639 - download that checklist to make sure 654.12 - they're prepared and that they're doing 655.6 - everything they can so think about 657.399 - something that you can offer for free 659.04 - that's really valuable but it's 660.88 - something that's easy to create but 662.88 - something that's lightweight and easy to 664.48 - consume for your audience as well and 666.6 - something that's easy to apply and for 669.16 - them to get a result with now again it 671.279 - needs to be related to your online 672.8 - course that you're going to be pitching 674.32 - but it doesn't need to solve the big 676.399 - problem that your course solves because 678.04 - if they feel like they've got the 679.48 - solution from a checklist or whatever 681.92 - freebie you offer they're not going to 683.839 - be likely to buy your cor so think of a 686.16 - small problem you can solve that's 688.12 - related to but isn't the same as the big 691.6 - problem that your online course solves 693.959 - and again once you've got your freebie 696.079 - you need to create a learning page where 698.16 - people can enter their name and email to 700.76 - get that free thing delivered to their 702.88 - inbox so after they enter their name and 704.8 - email address on the landing page then 706.92 - you're going to add them to your 707.92 - automated email sequence now this 709.88 - happens in your email service provider 711.72 - which is the software that you use to 713.76 - manage your email list and send out your 715.519 - automated email sequences and broadcasts 718.16 - personally I use active campaign it's a 720.44 - great tool for this really powerful 722.639 - really flexible and can do absolutely 724.6 - everything you could possibly want in 726.24 - terms of automation I'll leave a link 727.639 - down in the description below and what 729.8 - happens is once they enter your 731.56 - automated email sequence you're going to 734.0 - send out the first email now the first 736.36 - email is going to contain a link to the 739.16 - thing that you promised so it's really 740.48 - important that you deliver on that but 742.279 - it's also going to expand on that 744.0 - continue to give a little bit of value 746.04 - and then leave a cliffhanger at the end 748.32 - telling them that you've got even more 750.04 - coming for them tomorrow then the next 752.639 - day you're going to send email number 754.32 - two in email number two you want to 757.199 - agitate the problem you want to continue 759.639 - to educate them and explain why it's 762.16 - really important for them to solve that 764.399 - problem now so let's go back to my 766.36 - example where I said I could provide a 768.88 - checklist on how to prepare for the iOS 771.72 - 14 privacy changes with Facebook ads now 775.279 - in this second email I could go into 777.24 - more detail explaining that if if you're 779.399 - not prepared for these changes you're 781.56 - not going to be giving as much data to 784.16 - Facebook and Facebook uses that data to 787.6 - optimize your ads and improve your ads 789.639 - performance so less data is going to 791.839 - mean poor ad performance and that's why 794.839 - it's really important to solve this 796.36 - problem and then I could also talk about 799.04 - how without complete data you can't make 801.36 - good decisions with your Facebook ads 803.32 - and so you really need to solve this 804.839 - problem right now then the next day I 807.199 - would send the third email and in this 809.6 - email it's where you pitch Your solution 813.16 - so in the second email we agitated the 815.24 - problem a little bit explain why it's 816.56 - important to solve and in this third 818.32 - email you're going to present your 819.68 - course and explain why it is the best 822.519 - solution to that problem and how it's 825.079 - going to solve it for them so this is 827.24 - your big pitch for your course the next 829.88 - day you're going to send email number 831.6 - four and this is going to be the future 834.32 - State email so this is where I like to 836.48 - paint that picture of what the future 838.32 - looks like after you've solved the 841.079 - problem so for my example again the iOS 843.48 - 14 and the Privacy changes if I had a 846.16 - solution here that just walked them 848.16 - through step by step everything they 849.959 - needed to do to get as much data as 852.48 - possible back to Facebook after these 854.72 - changes then I could now explain what 857.839 - the future looks like after implementing 860.199 - this so I could show examples of before 862.36 - and after I implemented what I teach in 864.32 - the course and show what my students did 866.36 - and how to improve their results so 868.12 - think about how you can show that future 870.8 - State and what life looks like after 873.92 - people go and Implement what's in your 875.56 - online course or coaching program and 877.44 - then on day five it's all about 878.88 - frequently asked questions and your 880.399 - final pitch so I like to address any 882.519 - questions in this final day email that 884.759 - my students normally have and then go 887.279 - into the final pitch and explain how the 889.639 - course is going to help them and why 891.759 - they really need to join now okay so 894.36 -

on YouTube write down your goals in the comments\u00a0 section now I'm not going to waste your time I'm\u00a0\u00a0 15.06 - not going to teach you how to cope with anxiety\u00a0 I'm gonna ask you to take radical responsibility\u00a0\u00a0 21.3 - for your anxiety so that means I'm gonna ask\u00a0 you to change the things that you can change\u00a0\u00a0 26.22 - but I'll teach you the skills to do that so\u00a0 let's start with a story in this video you'll\u00a0\u00a0 31.14 - learn why many attempts to reduce anxiety or\u00a0 manage stress backfire and what to do instead 41.48 - [Music] now many people just want their anxiety to\u00a0 go away they just don't want to feel it they they\u00a0\u00a0 52.8 - imagine that if they didn't feel anxious their\u00a0 lives would be so much better and so they set that\u00a0\u00a0 58.2 - as their goal they their goal is my goal is to not\u00a0 feel so anxious but when your goal is to feel less\u00a0\u00a0 65.64 - of something you essentially have to cut something\u00a0 out of your life and the problem with that is that\u00a0\u00a0 71.1 - your world shrinks and then as it becomes more\u00a0 miserable then your anxiety actually grows now\u00a0\u00a0 78.12 - let me give you an example researchers wanted\u00a0 to explore how anxiety impacted people so they\u00a0\u00a0 83.94 - decided to interview a group of 8th graders who\u00a0 were in the process of auditioning for plays and\u00a0\u00a0 89.34 - trying out for sports teams and of running for\u00a0 school counselor and the researchers asked the\u00a0\u00a0 94.56 - kids to rate their anxiety on a scale from zero to\u00a0 ten and about half of the kids said oh I am really\u00a0\u00a0 100.2 - nervous and they rated their anxiety at a seven\u00a0 and eight or a nine and of these nervous kids some\u00a0\u00a0 107.58 - of the kids auditioned and some of them didn't now\u00a0 in the follow-up researchers asked the kids who\u00a0\u00a0 113.34 - tried out anyway they said you were really nervous\u00a0 why did you try out and the general response was\u00a0\u00a0 119.7 - auditioning was the only way to get into the play\u00a0 I had to face my anxiety in order to accomplish\u00a0\u00a0 124.8 - my goals and then they asked the group of kids\u00a0 that had high anxiety and didn't try out they\u00a0\u00a0 130.8 - asked them the same question and they answered\u00a0 I didn't try out because that was the only way\u00a0\u00a0 136.08 - I could make my anxiety go away the only way to\u00a0 make your anxiety go away completely is to avoid\u00a0\u00a0 142.56 - the things you care about in life now just like\u00a0 those kids who decided not to audition if your\u00a0\u00a0 148.32 - only goal is to feel less to feel less sad to feel\u00a0 less stress then you'll end up shrinking your life\u00a0\u00a0 155.76 - away now I told you that this course is about your\u00a0 relationship with anxiety now sometimes when we\u00a0\u00a0 160.68 - have to interact with a difficult person like a\u00a0 family member or a co-worker all we want is for\u00a0\u00a0 165.9 - that person to go away we don't want to have to\u00a0 deal with the discomfort of interacting with them\u00a0\u00a0 171.0 - so we avoid them or we fantasize about quitting\u00a0 our job or divorcing a spouse right and with some\u00a0\u00a0 177.84 - people we can cut them out of our lives but if\u00a0 our only tool in relationships is to separate from\u00a0\u00a0 184.44 - difficult people we're going to end up very lonely\u00a0 because all close relationships have difficulties\u00a0\u00a0 191.52 - instead in real close relationships we learn new\u00a0 skills we learn how to communicate clearly how\u00a0\u00a0 198.06 - to set healthy boundaries how to ask for what\u00a0 you need how to problem solve assertively right\u00a0\u00a0 203.16 - when you learn how to do this the difficult person\u00a0 won't bother you so much and you can get all the\u00a0\u00a0 209.22 - joy that healthy relationships bring so instead\u00a0 in this course I'm going to teach you how to get\u00a0\u00a0 215.7 - better at feeling I mean yes your anxiety probably\u00a0 will decrease but way more importantly the goal of\u00a0\u00a0 222.78 - this course is to make your life awesome again to\u00a0 fill your life with the things you care about the\u00a0\u00a0 228.18 - people and the experiences that you've cut\u00a0 out the dreams and the accomplishments that\u00a0\u00a0 232.68 - you're afraid to try and to bring richness and\u00a0 joy back to your day instead of worry and fear\u00a0\u00a0 240.06 - so what was the difference between those two\u00a0 groups of kids they both had high anxiety but\u00a0\u00a0 245.04 - one of them decided that their goal was worth it\u00a0 to face anxiety and the other set decided that\u00a0\u00a0 250.74 - the thing they wanted most was for their anxiety\u00a0 to go away the difference was not the level of\u00a0\u00a0 256.02 - anxiety but how the kids related to their anxiety\u00a0 now with those kids when the next audition came\u00a0\u00a0 262.38 - around which group do you think was more anxious\u00a0 which one felt better about themselves which set\u00a0\u00a0 269.22 - felt more confident which set of kids decided to\u00a0 audition again most likely the group that tried it\u00a0\u00a0 275.1 - the group that faced their anxiety but motivation\u00a0 matters when facing anxiety so here's the thing\u00a0\u00a0 280.8 - that most people don't understand about anxiety\u00a0 when your main goal is to make your anxiety go\u00a0\u00a0 285.6 - away you believe it's the anxiety that's ruining\u00a0 your life and you imagine that if your anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 290.52 - went away then you'd be happy and while anxiety\u00a0 can be really uncomfortable it's not actually the\u00a0\u00a0 296.4 - anxiety that's ruined in your life it's your\u00a0 attempts to escape anxiety that are actually\u00a0\u00a0 302.04 - decreasing your quality of life don't believe me\u00a0 let's look at some common examples social anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 308.88 - you stop going to parties because you don't want\u00a0 to feel anxious there you constantly worry about\u00a0\u00a0 314.16 - what you said in an attempt to figure out the\u00a0 perfect thing to say so that you don't have to\u00a0\u00a0 318.66 - feel anxious when you say the wrong thing so then\u00a0 you begin to worry and feel lonely all the time\u00a0\u00a0 325.32 - okay someone with OCD they fear that they've\u00a0 touched something with germs and this thought\u00a0\u00a0 330.9 - makes them anxious so they engage in a behavior\u00a0 like hand washing to make that feeling go away but\u00a0\u00a0 336.54 - the feeling comes back so they wash their hands\u00a0 a hundred times to try to make that feeling go\u00a0\u00a0 341.22 - away but even though their skin is raw the feeling\u00a0 comes back then they just avoid going outside to\u00a0\u00a0 346.98 - avoid feeling anxious about touching something and\u00a0 before long the quality of life has gone way down\u00a0\u00a0 353.88 - now sometimes the way we attempt to avoid anxiety\u00a0 aren't nearly as obvious we may seek constant\u00a0\u00a0 359.52 - reassurance from our spouse to avoid feeling\u00a0 anxious about whether they love us or we may\u00a0\u00a0 365.1 - constantly worry to try to prevent ourselves from\u00a0 feeling disappointed if something bad does happen\u00a0\u00a0 371.16 - yes you'll learn a lot more about worry later but\u00a0 you do it you worry to avoid anxiety and worry\u00a0\u00a0 378.72 - also fuels anxiety another way is we may convince\u00a0 ourselves that we're worthless and broken so that\u00a0\u00a0 384.54 - we don't have to risk uncertainty and the anxiety\u00a0 of trying and failing so how has anxiety impacted\u00a0\u00a0 392.94 - your life take the time to fill out your workbook\u00a0 what have you cut out of your life due to anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 400.86 - um what situations people experiences\u00a0 opportunities have you lost due to trying\u00a0\u00a0 406.68 - to not feel anxiety for many people anxiety has\u00a0 robbed them of Joy or more accurately how they\u00a0\u00a0 414.0 - interact with their anxiety has robbed them of\u00a0 Joy they feel sick and worried when they should be\u00a0\u00a0 419.46 - relaxing or it's made it hard for them to do their\u00a0 job or succeed in school or they withdraw from\u00a0\u00a0 425.64 - friends or stop going places in this course I'm\u00a0 going to teach you a bunch of skills to decrease\u00a0\u00a0 430.38 - your anxiety to better understand your anxiety\u00a0 to change how you think and feel about anxiety\u00a0\u00a0 436.38 - and how to make space for and tolerate anxiety\u00a0 but the goal of this course isn't just to make\u00a0\u00a0 442.32 - your anxiety go away trying to not feel something\u00a0 is what's called dead people goals the only people\u00a0\u00a0 449.4 - who don't feel any anxiety are people who are dead\u00a0 so to do that work to get better at feeling which\u00a0\u00a0 456.84 - will sometimes be uncomfortable you're going to\u00a0 need something you care about more more than just\u00a0\u00a0 462.48 - making anxiety go away so in this course I'm going\u00a0 to be asking you to do hard things so that's why I\u00a0\u00a0 467.82 - need you to get really clear on what is your why\u00a0 what kind of Life do you want to be living now\u00a0\u00a0 474.18 - I'm not going to ask you to just suck it up to\u00a0 just deal with anxiety I'm going to teach you a\u00a0\u00a0 479.4 - bunch of skills to lower your anxiety but if your\u00a0 only goal is to just feel less anxiety I can tell\u00a0\u00a0 486.54 - you where that will lead you to a life that is\u00a0 constantly getting smaller the only way to feel\u00a0\u00a0 493.44 - less is to cut the things you care about out of\u00a0 your life you avoid performing and then you avoid\u00a0\u00a0 498.96 - going places and then you avoid acquaintances\u00a0 and you procrastinate schoolwork or you break up\u00a0\u00a0 502.92 - with your partner and your life gets smaller and\u00a0 smaller and smaller and you know what you're left\u00a0\u00a0 507.24 - with depression and anxiety now when I painted\u00a0 that picture did you feel like that sense of\u00a0\u00a0 514.74 - hopelessness of like that dread and that like cold\u00a0 shutdown like is your goal in life really about\u00a0\u00a0 521.46 - not feeling the Paradox of anxiety is that the\u00a0 more we try to make it go away the more messages\u00a0\u00a0 527.1 - we send to our brain that this anxiety thing is\u00a0 really important and your brain actually makes it\u00a0\u00a0 532.74 - louder it increases the neurons around anxiety and\u00a0 it makes you more anxious so if we want to change\u00a0\u00a0 538.98 - our relationship with anxiety we need to focus\u00a0 on what we do want not what we're trying to avoid\u00a0\u00a0 544.68 - so what happens if you imagine being able to do\u00a0 the things you love like write about that what\u00a0\u00a0 551.16 - if you imagine being around the people you love\u00a0 boldly chasing your dreams traveling the world\u00a0\u00a0 557.16 - loving intensely dancing wildly speaking your\u00a0 truth and living your life what does it feel\u00a0\u00a0 563.22 - like if you imagine that does it feel a little\u00a0 light do you feel a little bit of excitement\u00a0\u00a0 568.8 -

And welcome to Crash Course Economics. 5.029 - Adriene: So far we talked about GDP and how the overall economy, but we haven't really 10.07 - talked about why some countries have a high GDP and others have low GDP. So, why are some 16.68 - countries rich, and others poor? 21.32 - Let's investigate. 25.28 - Mr. Clifford: Look, a clue! Productivity! 28.92 - Adriene: Hmm... 30.16 - [Theme Music] 39.04 - Mr. Clifford: So, if we're gonna figure out why some countries are rich and some are poor, 42.539 - we have to first define what it means to be rich. 44.67 - Economists measure economic output by looking at Gross Domestic Product or GDP. As you remember 49.87 - from the last video, GDP is the market value of all goods and services newly produced in a country in one year. 54.42 - India's GDP is over six times larger than the GDP of Singapore, but that doesn't mean 58.6 - the average Indian is richer than the average Singaporean. That's because India has 240 62.54 - times more people than Singapore. 64.86 - So, economists look at something called GDP per capita, to determine how wealthy a country 69.04 - is. GDP per capita is the GDP of the country divided by its population. It represents output 73.8 - per person, and a country with a high GDP per capita is considered rich. 77.22 - Of course, some of you may say being rich has nothing to do with GDP or money. It has 80.8 - to do with whether or not you're happy. Fine, money may not buy happiness, but it can prevent 85.07 - a lot of misery. The United Nations' Human Development Index, or HDI, measures life expectancy, 89.64 - literacy, education, quality of life, and it ranks countries according to their findings. 94.02 - The data shows the country that have a high GDP per capita have far less infant mortality, 98.68 - poverty and preventable diseases. 100.25 - So, economists often used GDP per capita to measure a country's standard of living. Countries 104.73 - with the lowest standard of living are the ones that are conventionally considered poor. 107.77 - So, why are some countries poor? 109.36 - Adriene: If you ask someone on the street, they might say the difference is due to lack 112.24 - of natural resources or inept governments, that is if the person doesn't subscribe to some 116.5 - antiquated racial or social Darwinist stereotypes -- but we should talk about those ideas. Well, 121.74 - let's skip the racial and social Darwinists stereotypes, but resources and leadership are interesting. 126.78 - First, resources. Look at Singapore: third in GDP per capita and ninth on the Human Development 131.73 - Index. Or Switzerland, ninth in GDP per capita and third on the HDI. Singapore is a teeny 136.95 - tiny island, and Switzerland's main natural resources is cows. And cows are great! I love 142.95 - cows, love love, but they aren't really natural resources. 146.49 - Zimbabwe, on the other hand, has tons of natural resources, like fertile soil, coal and rare 151.56 - minerals, but their economy? It's a wreck. It's a hundred and sixty first (161st) in 156.569 - GPD per capita and a hundred and fifty sixth (156th) on the HDI. Their incompetent 161.209 - and corrupt government keeps them poor. 163.25 - For comparison sake, the GDP per capita in the US is 18 times higher than in Bangladesh, 168.43 - and we're not just trouncing Bangladesh. GDP per capita wise, we're also crushing the GDP 173.88 - numbers of our great-grandparents. Take that, Aloysius! 177.18 - GDP per capita in the US today is about 8 times higher than a hundred years ago. That's 182.65 - pretty impressive. Maybe the Thought Bubble can produce an explanation. 187.14 - Mr. Clifford: Let's say John runs a bakery. Each worker to produce a dozen donuts per 190.68 - hour, and each donut sells for $1. If John wants to stay in business, he can't pay his 195.08 - workers more than $12 an hour. 196.73 - Obviously, he needs to pay for the ingredients and the oven, but even if you wanted to be 200.51 - generous, he couldn't pay them $20 an hour. They just don't produce enough for us to cover 204.14 - the cost. But if John can find a way for each worker to produce four dozen donuts per hour, 208.8 - he can pay them $20 per hour. Simply put, the more that each worker can produce, 213.6 - the more money each can earn. 215.22 - Economists argue that the main reason some countries are rich is because of their productivity. 219.44 - Their ability to produce more output, per worker, per hour. US workers, altogether, 223.44 - earn 18 times more per hour than Bangladeshi workers, because they're able to produce 18 228.31 - times more output per hour. US workers today earn 8 times more per hour than US workers 232.709 - a hundred years ago, because they produce 8 times more output per hour. But not only 236.7 - is US producing more stuff, it's also producing higher value products, like Avengers movies and jet engines. 242.26 - So going back to our bakery example, it's like a worker from a hundred years ago be 245.09 - able to produce six plain donuts per hour, while workers today is able to produce 60 248.71 - salted caramel designer cupcakes per hour. 250.5 - Adriene: Thanks, Thought Bubble. Before we go further, we need to point out the limitations 254.02 - of this bakery example. It's true, productivity is key. A country that is more productive 259.209 - can create more stuff and can generate higher incomes, but in real life, it doesn't always look like that. 264.26 - For example, in the US, the GDP per capita has been steadily increasing for decades, 269.52 - but median family incomes haven't changed much at all. This gets to issues of income 274.56 - inequality, and we're gonna devote an entire episode to it. 277.5 - Limitations aside, low productivity remains a fundamental reason why some countries are 282.08 - poor. Higher productivity not only helps explain why we have more money to buy stuff, but also 286.949 - why we have more stuff to buy. And speaking of stuff to buy, because it is socially unacceptable 292.0 - somehow for me to appear in the same clothes over and over, I need 40 blouses to make this 297.22 - series. That is a lot of blouses. That strains resources, pollutes the planet, and at high 302.22 - levels like 40 is completely unsustainable. Don't worry though, some of these are from thrift stores. 308.02 - So what about people in poor countries? What do they need? Well, they need food, clothing 311.94 - and housing, they need clean water and plumbing and sewers, they need hospitals and medicine, 316.32 - but all those things have to be produced, so a country that produces more of these things 320.05 - with fewer resources is gonna be wealthier and healthier, and perhaps even happier than 324.83 - a country that can't. But making a million cell phones isn't very impressive if your 328.87 - country has a hundred million people, so we need to look at how much stuff we produce 333.85 - per person. That's GDP Per Capita. 336.38 - Mr. Clifford: So if everything all boils down to productivity, what makes some countries 339.82 - more productive than others? Well, let's go back and look at the main ingredients that 343.1 - we need to produce things, what economists call the factors of production. 346.15 - First, you need land, which includes all natural resources, and then you need workers which 350.15 - is labor, and then you need capital which includes machines and factories and infrastructure, 354.31 - things you need to produce other things. One special type of capital is the workers' education, 358.699 - knowledge and skills required to produce things. Economists call this human capital. So school's 363.09 - not just about torturing you, except for PE, it's about helping your human capital. 366.74 - The quantity and quality of these resources is the first step to being more productive, 371.38 - but perhaps even more important is how you use them. Increasing the amount of capital 374.68 - has a cost, but finding new ways to organize production is virtually free. Economists call 379.53 - the organizational effectiveness \"technology.\" Think of it as the good ideas about how to 383.58 - combine labor and capital that you already have. 385.84 - US workers produce so much more than Bangladeshi workers because the US has more factories, 389.7 - robots, and computers. But more capital only gets you so far; it increases your production 394.47 - capacity but it also eats up some of that production capacity. You have to develop more 398.35 - factories and workers and machines to make more capital, and then replace them when they 402.16 - wear out. Technology on the other hand takes the same amount of resources and organizes 406.74 - them in a way to produce more output. 408.38 - Adriene: Here's an example. Twenty-five years ago, you could find computers in just about 411.87 - every workplace in the US, but productivity growth in the US was flat. Then, starting 416.729 - in about 1995, US productivity boomed, led by computer technology. SO what changed? 423.149 - In the late 80's and early 90's, most workplace computers were individual units, plugged into 428.37 - nothing but an electric outlet. They were useful for writing and printing documents, 431.71 - or acting as overgrown calculators, and playing Oregon Trail, but that was about it. When 437.229 - the World Wide Web came along everything changed. 439.86 - It turns out that computers are far more useful when they can talk to each other. The computer 443.699 - at the store could talk to the computer at the warehouse which could talk to the computer 446.97 - at the factory. That means I can get a new blouse from the other side of the world pretty 451.41 - much immediately. Connectivity equals productivity. Productivity in the US boomed for the next 456.83 - 10 years, and wages jumped as a result. 458.889 - 200 years ago, productivity in the US wasn't that great, but it grew a little bit every 464.07 - year. Compounding that over decades and centuries gives us the huge gap between the US standard 469.06 - of living and that of many developing countries. The good news is that in recent decades, many 473.5 - developing countries, like China, South Korea, Mexico and Ghana have dramatically improved 478.169 - their capital in technology and have seen their living standards rise. 481.069 - So if you want a single, one-word answer as to why some countries are more successful 484.819 - than others, here it is: Productivity. So if you look at the big picture-- 488.419 - Mr. Clifford: And by \"big picture,\" we mean both globally and historically-- 491.46 - Adriene: increasing productivity has resulted in increased standards of living for much 495.93 - of humanity over the last hundred years, and it's hard to argue that this is a bad thing. 500.33 - Mr. Clifford: Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week. 502.22 - Thanks for watching Crash Course Economics.

You have to go to the landing page of the course 64.4 - and then you have to click on the Enroll for Free button  67.96 - the 1st way which I'm telling you in that after clicking on this button  71.52 - you will see 2 options in one option it will ask you to purchase the course 75.6 - and in the 2nd it says you can do the whole course for free but  78.72 - you won't get any certificate in this you have to simply click on the 2nd  82.12 - option and this is the same way that I have explained 85.0 -  in the IIM Ahmedabad video also. 87.6 - as soon as you click on this you get access to the whole course 91.24 - you can complete the whole course at your own pace. 94.84 - But you won't get the certificate that is the only difference. 97.64 - So this is the 1st method the 2nd method is using the Audit option  101.68 - in this also same way will be followed you will simply click  104.72 - on the enroll for the free button but the difference here will be  107.96 - that you will get the whole course in the Audit option instead of the  110.76 - No certificate option.  114.24 - Now I don't know why this difference is there in some courses and so    118.92 - But in some courses instead of a full course no certificate  122.32 - they simply give you the audit option.  124.56 - Which means that both are the same if you will click on this Audit 129.84 - option then also you will get the access for this course for free. 131.4 - Without any certifiate. 132.76 - The 3rd way is of specilaization courses this is one of the interesting thing.  137.0 - I will explain this so in Coursera 2 types of course are their 140.48 - One that is normal courses and secondly there are some courses 143.96 - which is a part of specialization just consider that by clubbing  147.28 - 4-5 courses you made a specialization  149.48 - e.g. Data Analysis and Presentation Skills  153.56 - This a specialization of PWC in this specailization 156.8 - there is one amazing course called Data-Driven Decision Making by PWC 160.44 - which I have recommended in this channel. 162.44 - If you want to do consulting then do this course  165.0 - So when students search for this course in Google then generally 168.52 - this specialization page opens and here you can't see any enroll for free  172.2 - option but simply to enroll option is given  175.12 - and when you will click on it you won't get any full course no certificate  178.76 - option neither you will get the Audit button  181.76 - then students say that we wanted to do this course for free but  185.0 - here there is no such option. 186.32 - There is a option but people don't know that so what you have to do is  189.484 - you will simply scroll down and click on the courses button  193.084 - By this, all the courses of this particular specialization will be visible 196.2 - to you and then in that particular course  198.96 - i.e. when you will click on the Data-Driven Decision-Making course 202.0 - then you will see the enroll for free button  204.96 - and when you will click on it then you will see the audit button also. 209.2 - So this is another way through which you can do the specialization  211.84 - courses for free and I'm pretty sure that many of the students  215.4 - might not know about this.  216.4 - The final method i.e. 4th one is called financial aid 220.4 - With this method, you can complete any course on Coursera for free 223.68 - and you can avail a certificate also for that particular course.  229.8 - But to do this you need a time of 15 days  233.36 - Now let me explain what's the process for that  235.56 - Financial aid means that you are willing to do a course but if 240.4 - you can't afford it then simply you will click on a button  244.2 - which is next to the enroll for free option called financial aid 247.92 - as soon as you will click on this it will ask you some questions. 251.36 - Whether you will complete this course then you will click on Yes  254.4 - Secondly, you will explain in 150 words why you are applying  258.12 - for financial aid and then you can submit this application  262.24 - I have got much feedback from the users of this channel that  265.12 - whenever they apply for financial aid within 15 days  268.92 - their application gets approved application means  271.92 - basically, the form which you have submitted within 15 days 275.52 - of its submission, you will get the whole course freely accessible  279.32 - and you will get the certificate also if you will complete it  282.4 - here a question arises that do I have to wait for 15 days  285.48 - to start any course. NO 287.8 - You can simply start with the process of the first 3 methods  291.0 - i.e. you can do an audit or else click on the full course no certificate option  295.4 - and along with that, you can apply for financial aid.  299.08 - The process of financial aid will take 15 days but till that  302.48 - as much as the course you have completed till that 305.04 - it will be counted on your progress after that simply on your course 308.72 - a certificate option will be added on no other difference is their 311.96 - So you can do the courses for free you can also get the certificate for free  316.04 - and I hope this video helps you if it does then please do give it a  318.04 - thumbs up so that it can reach more students who are willing to do  322.64 - Coursera courses for free. 324.64 - If you want to watch the video of IIM Ahmedabad's free courses 328.08 - then it is linked here. I hope that you can do the courses for free now. 331.96 - Thank you so much for watching these guys "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Free Courses on Coursera 0:30 - Addressing Misconceptions: Proof of Free Courses 0:52 - Method 1: Full Course Without Certificate 1:38 - Method 2: Using the Audit Option 2:12 - Method 3: Accessing Specialization Courses for Free 3:36 - Method 4: Applying for Financial Aid 4:46 - Combining Financial Aid with Other Methods 5:20 - Conclusion: Tips to Access Coursera Courses for Free"}]}

hello today we're going to go through a comparison of traditional 3.6 - versus integrated medicine courses my name's cami and i'm a second year 8.16 - medical student at the university of birmingham 10.32 - so choosing the right medical course is so important when applying for medicine 14.799 - you need to think about how you learn best so you can choose the best teaching 18.4 - style and therefore the best medical school 21.039 - for you so make sure you stick around till the end where i'll be giving you a 24.88 - top tip on why understanding how you learn 28.32 - best is important for your interviews so we've put together the medic mind 33.12 - university comparison guide which is linked below if you want more 36.48 - information so this will help you make a more informed decision on where to apply 41.76 - so as with any style of course there are advantages and disadvantages of each 46.399 - so we're going to be going through these two for the traditional and the 49.36 - integrated courses and also what kind of teaching you 52.8 - should expect so before we get going let me know in 56.32 - the comments whether you've looked into the traditional integrated courses 60.719 - yet and if you think you know which one 63.28 - you'd prefer so starting with the traditional courses 66.799 - there are currently only three of these in the uk 70.08 - and that's cambridge oxford and edge hill university 73.92 - so the key thing about traditional courses is that they split up the 77.04 - pre-clinical and the clinical aspect of the degree so 80.72 - you'll usually have about three of each so you'll usually have three years of 84.4 - pre-clin and then three years of clinical afterwards 87.439 - so during the pre-clinical phase students will usually learn 91.439 - the biochemistry physiology and a bit of anatomy 94.799 - before looking at any of the clinical side so often there'll be a lot of 99.439 - lab work a lot of research and also some essays as well particularly in oxbridge 104.479 - and the teaching style will be mainly lectures and 107.68 - some seminars so during the clinical years the next three years 112.32 - students will be able to have more patient contact and they'll be going on 115.759 - their clinical placements and there will still be teaching but 118.88 - it'll be much more clinical teaching so usually this will be in hospital and 123.119 - it'll be discussions in groups about patients you've seen so 126.799 - the benefits of a traditional course are that you have a great scientific 131.28 - basis before going into your clinical years 133.44 - so when you do get to placement you'll have a much better understanding of the 136.8 - science behind everything you see and everything should 139.68 - make more sense and you should get a good learning experience from your 143.04 - clinical years however you do have to wait till the third or fourth year 147.04 - to have any patient contact at all which some students don't like 150.8 - and it can be difficult for some students to 154.319 - basically only do the science for the first two or three years 157.68 - it can be a bit like doing a biomedical degree 160.8 - which can be difficult for some students as obviously applied to medicine which 165.519 - technically itself is a clinical course furthermore some students might find it 170.0 - difficult to learn when they're not applying their 172.56 - knowledge to practical clinical situations so make sure you are 177.599 - able to learn just from the lectures and the seminars 181.04 - for the first three years of your course if you're thinking about applying to a 184.4 - traditional course so the next is integrated courses so the 188.08 - key thing here is that the pre-clinical section and the clinical section 191.36 - overlap so the majority of unis in the uk 194.8 - have this kind of teaching style so they often use 198.0 - a spiral curriculum if you're not aware of what this is don't worry i'll go into 202.959 - more detail about it later on in the video 205.12 - and of course all medical schools are different some unis 209.04 - will only introduce the clinical side very sparingly from the beginning 213.28 - whereas other universities will have you in hospital from day one 216.4 - so it really depends from uni to uni a good way to compare this 220.239 - is to look at the number of days on placement per year 223.76 - so usually this information will be on the uni's website and it should be quite 228.319 - easy to find if not just get in touch with them obviously 231.44 - so often with integrated courses they use a system-based approach 236.239 - so for a particular system you'll learn the physiology 239.68 - biochemistry and anatomy along with the clinical correlations 243.84 - just for that system so say you were learning about 247.84 - copd you might have some lectures to start with 251.2 - on the physiology and the biochemistry and then you might have an anatomy 256.16 - sessions on the lungs and then you might go into your gp 260.959 - placement where you'll sit in with a gp for consultation for 265.199 - respiratory patients so teaching may also involve pbl which i 270.0 - will go into more detail into later on so many universities using an 274.639 - integrated approach we use a spiral curriculum as i've already mentioned 278.32 - so this is basically when you revisit the same topics or the same systems 283.12 - throughout your time at medical school and you're going to be 286.24 - building on the content every year so you're learning more and more 290.16 - so the benefits of an integrated course are that you get early patient contact 294.96 - and you're able to apply the scientific knowledge that you've 298.0 - learned to real-life cases as you go which does make learning 301.68 - easier for quite a lot of students so you'll also be learning clinical 305.199 - skills from early on so you might be taking blood pressure 308.72 - or you might be doing chest examinations whatever it is you'll be learning 312.24 - from earlier on rather than having it all at the end 315.52 - however this learning style does mean that sometimes on placement 319.36 - you'll be going in without enough scientific knowledge 323.52 - so you might be thrown in the deep end as such here 326.72 - and you might not get the full learning experience as you would if you knew all 329.919 - of the science so pbl is when students are split into 334.08 - groups often facilitated by a member of staff 337.6 - and they're given a problem that they have to solve between them 340.32 - so this requires a lot of self motivation and 343.68 - although it does develop those problem solving skills that are 347.36 - really really useful and in hospital it doesn't have that standardized approach 352.639 - so it can result in some students having gaps in their knowledge 356.0 - so it really is down to personal preference you have to understand how 359.52 - you learn best so you can pick a course where you will get the most out of your 363.52 - time at medical school so a final top tip 366.4 - at interview you might be asked why that course why that teaching style 370.8 - so you need to be able to talk about your learning style and how that suits 374.56 - the course that you've chosen if you'd like any help with choosing a 378.4 - medical school or with your medicine application 381.28 - then make sure to get in touch with the medic mind team so 384.56 - thanks for watching i hope you found this series on choosing 387.759 - your medical schools useful best of luck with your application and i'll see you 391.919 -

So I will tag here, first you watch that video, then 40.6 - you watch this video, so first of all let me tell you why I chose this course 45.039 - because I got the offer, I chose it and accepted it, so after my 50.399 - CAT exam result came. After the result, I 55.399 - was getting offers for all the other exams like NMIMS and SIBM, and then I 63.239 - got the offer of HAHM from Jammu, okay, there was also an offer from Sirmaur and Sambalpur too, so when 70.159 - I got this offer from IIM Jammu, so when you apply or fill the form, 75.68 - you have to choose this course, if you do not choose this then you will not get the offer, 79.56 - so I had applied for all the courses. When 84.84 - you receive an email after the result, first it came from IIM Jammu saying whether I want to 90.479 - apply for this course or not, so I clicked on it saying yes I want to 94.64 - apply for this course and then when When my CAT result came, I 99.68 - got an email of admission offer that I am eligible for that and I have been shortlisted 104.479 - for the personal interview PI. And after giving PI, then I got in 109.6 - to this course and I was in waitlist for General MBA so I was like I'm 116.439 - OK with this and I'm also OK with that obviously that is a regular MBA so everyone is OK for that 120.399 - but I was pretty much OK for health care management also. 124.719 - There was no problem, I have bio in 12th and I 128.399 - was interested in health care and you see the coincidence, I told you that my work experience 132.72 - is in Optum and that is also a health care industry and I am now 138.239 - doing health care management placement. I am in the placement committee so now I am tapping Optum to come for 142.8 - the campus placement now see the circle so this is it so I was offered this course I 150.76 - accepted and I also took admission and then I came here and I 155.92 - started studying, the most attractive thing that I find about this course is that this 161.159 - course is launched at I am Jammu in collaboration with AIIMS Jammu and IIT 166.12 - Jammu. Jammu is the only place in India where AIIMS 171.64 - IIT and IIM all three, I hope I am not wrong I am not wrong, it 176.519 - is in Jammu only if I am wrong then tell me but in Jammu only IIM, 181.84 - IIT and AIIMS are there so because of the presence of these three this course is very beneficial. When this 189.64 - course was made, because of all three institutes of national-level importance, 195.36 - this course was launched in IIM. Now let me tell you what subjects we 200.2 - study in it and how it happens. There is no special difference in it from General MBA 206.799 - Although there is a lot of difference, IIM and AIIMS and IIT, all the three institutes 211.799 - are involved, the faculty of IIM covers all the subjects of IIM, all 216.04 - the management related things like marketing, finance operations, business communication, 223.0 - all the core management syllabus are there in IIM. and whatever 229.239 - are the subjects of Health Care Management, the faculties of AIIMS Jammu visit us. 234.159 - We call them visiting faculty. We call them visiting faculty and they take our lectures. 239.959 - Faculty from IIT visit to teach us whatever technology related subject. Like, 244.0 - we have studied AIML, we are studying IoT, now 249.84 - the subjects are divided into three sections, so what are the subjects of IIM, we have 254.36 - the subjects of IIM, you get complete whatever is the core management subject, in the first year all 259.079 - the subjects are general MBA is the same as ours, the first year of Health Care Management 263.56 - is almost the same, just additional, we have Health Care 267.04 - subjects, we have Health Care subjects like 271.96 - Diagnostics, Insurance, Hospital Administration has some subjects, so 278.199 - these are the subjects for AIIMS. And about IIT, I told you that there is IoT, 282.56 - AIML and whatever technical aspect there is, whatever 287.28 - devices technology and stuff is there in the medical device industry, we have subjects in IIT 293.6 - and the faculty of IIT come to teach us. So if you have taken this course 297.72 - If you take admission, you 305.16 - get a chance to study from all the three IIT, IIM and AIIMS, which are institutes of national importance. In fact, we 311.52 - also had a project, we call it Independent Course of Study, not Course of 317.28 - Independent Study. We also got a project done. I have gone to AIIMS, Jammu, it 321.919 - is very beautifully built, I like it, it is huge and very beautiful, it is very beautiful, so we 328.08 - had to come and go daily for one week, we did a project there, our visit was 334.6 - like this, we went to AIIMS, so I Right now I am in the second year and my MBA will be completed 339.16 - in just five months, so my experience in these one and a half years is quite good, everything is good about this 345.52 - course, it is quite positive, as I said, I did not expect 351.919 - so much, hence my expectations. I am 357.0 - quite fine with what ever I am receiving right now here and anyway it is IIM so 362.4 - do any course from IIM that will not go waste. If your interest is 367.599 - in health care management then you should definitely consider. This course is not like that if you 373.16 - are a doctor, if you are from health care background then only you can come in this course, there 377.039 - is nothing like that in my class, there are engineers, chemical engineers, electrical engineers, 381.52 - civil engineers, there are also doctors and people from life sciences. I am a normal BA 387.8 - , I have done BSc so there is a huge diversity in my class and that's how it is, 394.599 - this does not necessarily means that you must have something in health care, only then you 399.72 - will come for this course because you are doing MBA. You are studying the same thing, 405.28 - it is the entire management domain, you are studying the entire management domain, the only difference 409.919 - is that after joining this course, your summer internship is 415.0 - to be done in a health care organization, but it is mandatory for you. There is a final placement 420.44 - and it is not necessary in a health care organization. You are open to take placement to work in any industry 427.72 - and the final placement is completely open for 433.919 - everyone in any field but in summer internship you have to do it in health care only. And 440.639 - health care is a huge industry. It is a booming industry. Many of you people 444.879 - do not know what health care management means where will you get the job. I will tell 450.52 - you I am sure. Pharmaceuticals Glenn Mark Cipla Digit Insurance ADFC Live A 458.599 - Metronics Max Health Care. Photos, there are so many big brands in which you 464.56 - can get placed and now there are many such organizations which 470.36 - have a health care domain, like PW, PW, Health Care, the health 475.12 - care domain is very big, their contribution is very big, we have made a pact with them. We have Cognizant, we have 481.599 - Infosys, all of them have health care domain, Optum is the one in which I worked, 486.919 - Providence is UHG, United Health Group, there are so many companies, so many 492.919 - big organizations which have health care domain, so if any company has 497.599 - Health care is the domain and if you have done health care management from IIM then 502.759 - why won't you be considered? Why won't you get the opportunity to work there? You 506.919 - will definitely get it if you have the ability. Then one more thing comes that recently 512.919 - commented on me. Someone had told me that you will not feel restricted or 516.8 - how will you work in a corporate. You can also work in health care by 520.68 - becoming a hospital administrator but it is nothing like that, it is a very big field, there 525.48 - are a lot of opportunities, there are many things. You can work in a medical device company, 530.16 - you can work in pharmaceuticals, there is insurance, IT and consulting, health 534.6 - care too, there are so many things, there is no dearth of opportunity, you 539.44 - should have the ability, that's it and I am studying from Jammu. After this, you will get 543.56 - placement from the campus, to jo aapke first placement from the campus, na wahi to 548.76 - zindagi nahi hai aapki, that could be a major factor for your career growth but that is not 554.72 - the only factor for your career growth, right first placement from the campus. Whatever you take from, 560.36 - after that, you will switch after one year, two years, whatever time 565.959 - you switch, it depends on your skills, what was your job role, 570.519 - what kind of work you have done and what you need. Beyond that, it depends, for 575.399 - example, if I get placement in any health care sector from I am Jammu, 579.88 - for example, suppose Sipla, suppose I get placed in Sipla, then it is not that 585.839 - I will keep roaming only in health care. Rest of the sectors, big four lots, 591.959 - I will not get a chance in all these things, there is nothing like that, I 599.36 - can go to W, I can also go to EY, it all depends on me. 605.64 - Skills My Growth and My Capabilities No course 611.24 - can stop you from moving ahead Yes one can definitely give you a push One can definitely give you a platform to grow your career 617.8 - But that can't be the only factor That's the thing about 623.88 - In this course, if any doubt comes, what I am not able to tell, if you want to know 628.48 - then ask in the comment section of this video, I will reply you there and if 632.839 - more questions and queries come then I will create a separate QNL Dangi and also like That 637.72 - I told you that in the video in the profile I have told that my first attempt 642.839 - was of CAT, its first attempt was ok, my result came in 2022 and I 648.6 - got this admission offer and I took the admission, I took the drop again and I 654.639 - again I did not want to study after preparation, I did not want to give more attempts, 660.0 - so this is also a reason that I took admission in this course, if I had 665.92 - a lot of time, like after my graduation, I 670.92 - had completed my graduation in 2020. 2122 I was a drop of 2 years, I got admission in IM Jammu in 23, 678.24 - I am of 2325 batch, I was already a drop of 2 years, if I thought that it 682.839 - was my first attempt, I may come in the second attempt with 90 plus percentile and no one else. 689.56 - Generation: If I get another good IIM, I could have done it, I might have become a B, but I 696.68 - did not want to give this thing one more year, read all those things again, give CAT again, 701.48 - I was not in that mental state, so I Gave CAT once, got 86 percentile, I got admission offer for HAHM course, I took admission and 712.68 - now I am studying and I am very happy, I have no problem with anything, so ya 717.0 - guys, that's it. About this video I think you must have got the basic idea 721.76 - about this course and the importance of this course. If 725.92 - you have any doubt about this course, please ask me in the comments. I may have forgotten to tell you or 731.079 - according to me, That's all I had to tell you, I told you but if you want to know something more 735.519 - and want to know in detail then don't forget to ask me  740.76 - I will end this video, see you next time, Bye!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to the Video 0:56 - Why I Chose MBA HAHM at IIM Jammu 3:18 - Application and Admission Process 5:20 - Course Structure and Collaboration with AIIMS and IIT Jammu 7:05 - Subjects and Faculty Overview 9:10 - Placement Opportunities and Healthcare Industry Insights 11:00 - Summer Internship Requirements and Flexibility in Placements 12:50 - Career Growth Beyond First Placement 14:20 - Personal Experience and Decision to Join"}]}

We might find out. Will we find out Stan? 18.46 - Anyway, I have a question for you. Have you ever wondered where your tax dollars go or 22.029 - why people complain about it so much? Or who pays for the highway that runs past your house? 25.96 - Or why you use the textbooks you use in science class? Or why you need a license to drive, 29.909 - or to hunt or to fish or to become a barber? I\u2019ve always wanted to cut my own hair, back 33.51 - when I had it. Have you ever wondered why you have to be 35.239 - 21 years old to drink alcohol but only 18 to vote? Or gamble. Sometimes voting is a 39.559 - gamble - actually always. Do you get confused when you hear people talk about news about 43.16 - Wall Street regulations, or Obamacare, or the national debt? Do you wonder why there 46.32 - are so few cell phone carriers and cable companies? How about why it\u2019s ok for student groups 50.019 - to lead prayers in schools but not for the principal to do so? Have you ever wondered 53.309 - if there are any limits on when, where, and how the police can search your home, or your 57.14 - car, or your locker, or you, or your friend, or your grandma, or your grandma\u2019s friend? 61.98 - And do you know why you can stand outside a government office with a sign and a bullhorn 65.35 - complaining about military action that you think is unfair and the police can\u2019t stop 68.86 - you, but you can be fired from your job for doing the exact same thing? 71.58 - Have you ever been sued? Or fined? Ever wonder what the difference is between being sued 74.97 - and being fined? Have you ever wondered why the government 77.19 - does the things it does and why it doesn\u2019t do other things? Have you ever wondered what 80.25 - it would be like if we had no government at all? That would be anarchy. Can we play the 84.86 - Sex Pistols, Stan? That\u2019s probably illegal. Why is it illegal? 88.72 - And probably the most important, have you ever thought about how you can change the 91.93 - things that seem unjust or unfair or that you just don\u2019t like? 95.21 - Ok so that was more than one question, and obviously there isn\u2019t a single answer to 98.4 - all of those questions, except in a way, there is. The study of government and politics. 103.03 - And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about today, and this whole series: Crash Course 106.88 - Government and Politics - aptly titled. 109.44 - [Theme Music] 117.92 - So let\u2019s start by doing what human beings do when confronted with complicated questions 121.23 - they can\u2019t answer. We\u2019ll answer a simpler one. In this case, what are government and 124.68 - politics and why do I need to learn about them. 126.85 - Government is a set of rules and institutions people set up so they can function together 130.7 - as a unified society. Sometimes we call this a state, or a nation, or a country, or Guam. 135.33 - And I\u2019ll use these terms somewhat interchangeably - except for Guam, that might be a little 139.06 - confusing. So, we study government in order to become better citizens. 142.84 - Studying government enables us to participate in an informed way. Anyone can participate, 147.03 - but doing so intelligently that takes a little effort, and that\u2019s why we need to learn 150.39 - about how our government works. Politics is a little different. Politics is 153.29 - a term we used to describe how power is distributed in a government. And in the U.S it basically 157.34 - describes the decisions about who holds office and how individuals and groups make those 161.54 - decisions. Following politics is a lot like following 163.53 - sports in that there is a winner and a loser and people spend a lot of time predicting 166.569 - who will win and analyzing why the winner won and the loser lost. 169.28 - The outcome of an election might affect your life more than the outcome of a sports game 172.54 - though. Unless you\u2019re gambling - which might be illegal. 175.26 - Government is really important. Everyone born in America is automatically a citizen, and 178.49 - many people choose to become citizens every year so that they can have a say in the government. 182.209 - The USA is a republic, which means that we elect representatives to govern us, and a 185.81 - democracy, which means that citizens are allowed to participate. This ability to participate 189.5 - is something we take for granted, but we shouldn\u2019t. History tells us that that citizen participation 193.19 - is the exception rather than the rule. But we\u2019re not going to look at history. Who 195.85 - has time? That\u2019s what history courses are for with that other guy. 198.709 - So one way people can participate in government is through voting. And many people will tell 202.15 - you that that\u2019s pretty much the only way we can participate in government and politics, 205.59 - but THEY\u2019RE WRONG. And I love pointing out when people are wrong. Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 209.3 - Sure, when you mark a ballot, you are participating in the political process, but there are so many other 213.24 - things you can do to be an active citizen. You can contact your representatives and tell 216.38 - them what you think about a political issue. People used to do this by writing letters 219.599 - or sending telegrams, but now they tend to call or send email, although there\u2019s nothing 223.09 - like a good old-fashioned angry letter. People can work for campaigns or raise money 226.73 - or give money. They can display yard signs or bumper stickers. They can canvass likely 230.92 - voters, try to convince them to vote or even drive them to the polls on election day. 234.349 - You participate in politics when you answer a public opinion poll. Or when you write a 237.54 - letter to the editor or comment on an online article. You participate in politics when 241.13 - you blog, or tumbl, or make a YouTube video, or tweet. I guess even YouTube comment counts. 245.89 - First! Ever been to a march or a rally or held a 248.099 - sign or worn a t-shirt with a slogan on it, or discussed an upcoming election at the dinner 251.8 - table and tried to convince your parents who to vote for? You\u2019ve participated in the 255.29 - political process. And if you\u2019ve actually run for office you\u2019ve 257.93 - participated, even if you didn\u2019t win, and if you did win, congratulations, now get back 261.689 - to work. You should already know this. But probably the most important thing you 264.58 - can do to participate in government and politics is both the easiest and the most challenging. 268.84 - Become more educated! Anyone can be a citizen, but to be a good citizen requires an understanding 273.169 - of how government works, and how we can participate. It requires knowledge and effort and we have 277.409 - to do it because otherwise we end up being led rather than being leaders. We learn about 280.879 - politics because knowledge is our best defense against unscrupulous people who will use our 284.979 - ignorance to get us to do things that they want rather than what we think should be done. 288.48 - Thanks, Thought Bubble. That was my first Thought Bubble narration! Hurray! You guys 294.259 - are fun. This is fun. So that\u2019s where we come in. Over the course 297.61 - of this series we will be looking in depth at American government and politics. 300.939 - We\u2019ll be talking about stuff like the structure and function of the branches of government, 304.379 - the division of power between the national government and the state governments, what 307.439 - political parties are, what they do, and how they are different from interest groups. 310.779 - We\u2019ll examine the role the media plays in government and politics, how the legal system 314.029 - and the courts work and how they protect civil rights and civil liberties. 316.789 - We\u2019ll look at political ideologies: what it means when you say you are a liberal or 319.879 - a conservative or a libertarian or a socialist or an anarchist \u2013 okay we probably won\u2019t 324.469 - talk about anarchy because that\u2019s sort of the rejection of government. Again, Sex Pistols, 329.039 - Stan? Can\u2019t... copyright issue. 331.38 - I\u2019ll take care of it. ANARCHY - WOOO! I\u2019ve been known to do that from time to time. 336.18 - We\u2019ll try to understand the forces that are shaping American government and politics 339.33 - today. And we\u2019ll work towards becoming more involved and developing our knowledge so that 342.729 - we make our government more responsive and our politics more inclusive. 345.289 - By the end of this series \u2013 and actually before the end \u2013 you will understand how 348.24 - our government works and how you can make it work better for you and your community. 351.439 - Not only will you be able to answer most of the questions I started this episode with, 354.68 - but you will become, if you pay attention and think for yourself, a more engaged and 357.909 - active citizen. And you might have a beard - if you don\u2019t shave. 361.289 - Next week we\u2019ll talk about Congress, how it works, and what it does, when it does anything. 364.99 - Thanks for watching, I\u2019ll see you next week. And that\u2019s my first Crash Course episode! 369.409 - Are we out of poppers Stan? I\u2019ll just throw \u2018em\u2026 wooohoo! Bang! Wooo!

118.493 - So rather than saying, 119.577 - \"We're just gonna get rid of some large percentage 121.663 - of our nuclear weapons and hope 123.164 - that the USSR would do so as well,\" 125.917 - they broke up the interaction into a bunch 128.002 - of little tiny ones. 129.546 - So, the USSR would eliminate just a few nuclear weapons, 132.757 - then the U.S. would eliminate just a few nuclear weapons. 135.343 - They would check, and then they would go on 137.428 - to the next stage. 138.471 - And then each would eliminate a few more, 140.431 - and they'd go on to the next stage. 142.6 - This process of taking a big interaction 145.52 - and breaking it down into little small parts 147.647 - can change a bad social dilemma 150.275 - into a positive interaction. 153.278 - What I do in my personal life 154.737 - and I think almost everyone can do in their personal life, 157.031 - is to try and think, 158.575 - 'In this interaction, 160.118 - what outcome would be good for both parties?' 162.954 - And, 'How can we achieve that outcome?' 165.206 - And by thinking about everything in that way, 167.5 - we oftentimes transform something that seems 170.17 - like a situation where there has to be a winner 172.338 - and there has to be a loser, 173.715 - into one where nobody feels like they've lost 175.592 - and everybody benefits. 178.845 - - John von Neumann-based game theory 180.638 - on a stripped down version of poker. 183.141 - - In any given poker situation that you're dealing 185.185 - with a lot of uncertainty 187.312 - and it's all about how to make the best decision 191.816 - in any given moment- 193.693 - and that's so integral to life. 196.362 - Everything we try to do, you know, 197.864 - 'Should we take this route or that route?' 199.449 - 'Should I go here on vacation or there?' 201.951 - It's all about dealing with uncertainties 204.329 - and probabilities of things happening- 205.788 - and poker is a very fun and easy way 208.875 - to teach someone how to do that. 211.211 - First rule of thumb is how to extract the most money 215.048 - or chips from your opponent when you have a strong hand 218.051 - and how to lose the minimum when you have a weak hand. 221.346 - You're never going to be 100% certain where you are: 224.39 - are you beating them or do you have a worse hand? 227.06 - So, you have to sort of construct a strategy 230.48 - that is mathematically optimal in each situation. 236.319 - The most damaging bias that can come up in poker, 239.614 - and I also think very often in life, 241.449 - is the 'Sunk cost fallacy.' 244.494 - Where you'll have a lot of chips, 246.162 - perhaps almost all of your stack is in the middle, 248.498 - and yet, you are 85% to 90% confident 254.337 - that you have the worst hand. 256.506 - Putting another chip in the pot is probably not a good idea, 260.551 - but we'll often go to ourselves, 261.719 - \"Ah, well, I've gone this far. 263.721 - I've put this much in. 264.722 - I might as well see it through to the end.\" 266.641 - But if you have very strong information 269.018 - that actually, from this point onwards, 271.521 - putting more money in the pot is a bad idea, 273.398 - then you shouldn't. 274.899 - But we have this belief that, 275.942 - \"Well, I've put this much time in or this much effort, 278.278 - that we should continue on.\" 279.779 - That can be very, very costly. 282.448 - Once you start paying attention to the sunk cost fallacy, 284.951 - once it's on your radar, 286.494 - you'll probably notice at least a few things 288.162 - that you wish you were doing differently. 289.789 - Those might be small-scale. 291.624 - In my case, I'm now much more willing to abandon a book 295.003 - that I've realized I'm not enjoying 297.005 - and not getting any value out of, 299.59 - rather than trudging dutifully through the remainder 302.051 - of the book just because I've already come 100 pages. 306.389 - These changes might also be large-scale. 308.933 - For example, I was in a Ph.D. program, 311.352 - and, at a certain point, realized with increasing certainty 315.481 - that I wasn't happy in this field, 317.233 - and would probably be better off switching. 320.445 - And that the only reason that I had stuck with it 321.988 - as long as I had was because of my fear 324.365 - of confronting the sunk cost of four to five years 328.494 - that I'd spent preparing for and working in the Ph.D. 332.29 - And sometimes it really does take time 333.75 - to fully acknowledge to yourself 335.626 - that you don't have any good reason 337.628 - to stick with the job or Ph.D. 340.798 - or project that you've been working on so long 343.885 - because sunk costs are painful. 345.553 - But at least having the sunk cost fallacy on your radar 348.431 - means that you have the opportunity, at least, 350.35 - to push past that and make the choice 352.81 - that instead will lead to the better outcomes 354.937 - for your future. 357.023 - - Game theory spent much of its early days 359.275 - analyzing zero-sum games, 361.194 - where one party's gonna win and the other party's gonna lose 364.238 - to trying to figure out what's the best strategy. 366.991 - What game theorists have figured out 368.743 - is that in zero-sum games, 370.119 - the best strategy to pursue when you're against 372.789 - a sophisticated opponent is to adopt the strategy 376.626 - which minimizes your maximum loss. 380.797 - This is sometimes called the 'Minimax strategy.' 384.55 - So the idea is you think, 385.676 - \"What's the worst-case scenario for me? 388.721 - What could my opponent do that would make me worse off?\" 391.808 - And then you figure out, 393.267 - \"What's the best strategy against that?\" 398.398 - So you're minimizing your maximum loss. 401.859 - Game theorists proved that if you use this way of thinking, 405.071 - minimizing your maximum loss, you ensure that, 409.033 - no matter how sophisticated your opponent is, 411.411 - you've guarded against the worst-case scenario. 414.664 - And not only that, but in zero-sum games, 417.875 - you've done the best you can possibly do. 420.92 - - Get smarter, faster with videos 422.797 - from the world's biggest thinkers. 425.258 - To learn even more from the world's biggest thinkers, 428.177 - get Big Think+ for your business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to Strategic Interactions 0:15 - Understanding Game Theory 0:57 - Historical Foundations of Game Theory 1:45 - Applications of Game Theory Beyond Economics 2:18 - Cold War and Cooperation Strategies 3:12 - Breaking Down Social Dilemmas 4:05 - Lessons from Poker and Decision-Making 5:12 - The Sunk Cost Fallacy in Life and Decisions 6:02 - Zero-Sum Games and the Minimax Strategy 6:48 - Conclusion and Big Think Resources"}]}

how would i go about it? and that's exactly what\u00a0 this video is about i'll remove all the fluff and\u00a0\u00a0 36.0 - give you the fastest path to go from zero to\u00a0 a full-time data analyst and throughout this\u00a0\u00a0 41.52 - video i will share the three major mistakes almost\u00a0 every data analyst makes so stay tuned for those\u00a0\u00a0 47.28 - the first thing every beginner data analyst needs\u00a0 to pick is a tool or programming language for data\u00a0\u00a0 52.88 - analysis i personally started off with Excel is\u00a0 that the best tool there is for data analysis no\u00a0\u00a0 58.56 - if i could go back in time would have started\u00a0 with something else also no because apparently\u00a0\u00a0 63.92 - getting good at Excel was enough for my first\u00a0 data analysis job and i personally recommend\u00a0\u00a0 68.72 - every single data analyst to start off with\u00a0 Excel it's easy to learn used in almost every\u00a0\u00a0 73.44 - company and it has a wide range of applications\u00a0 for data analysis but this is also it's pitfall\u00a0\u00a0 79.52 - although you can do a lot of different things\u00a0 in Excel it's not designed specifically for\u00a0\u00a0 84.32 - data analysis meaning it has its limitations\u00a0 you want to work with a very large data set\u00a0\u00a0 89.28 - well good luck not punching through your computer\u00a0 screen after Excel crashes for the 27th time\u00a0\u00a0 96.48 - Excel is perfect for starting out but once\u00a0 you've mastered excel it's time to move on\u00a0\u00a0 101.36 - to the more serious tools and the most logical\u00a0 tool to learn next is SQL next to Excel it is\u00a0\u00a0 107.2 - apparently the second most requested skill in data\u00a0 analyst job openings huge thanks to Luke Barousse\u00a0\u00a0 113.6 - for actually scraping a lot of Linkedin\u00a0 job openings to come up with these facts\u00a0\u00a0 117.84 - you're a legend man thank you what up that nerds\u00a0 and the reason SQL is so in demand is because\u00a0\u00a0 122.4 - it doesn't have the same limitations as Excel\u00a0 why is my accent suddenly changing to southern\u00a0\u00a0 130.48 - i don't know what with SQL you can extract\u00a0 transform and load very large data sets but\u00a0\u00a0 135.52 - the best thing about it is that SQL has its own\u00a0 very easy to use programming language it's a great\u00a0\u00a0 140.88 - tool to add to your skill set as a data analyst\u00a0 while also being a great stepping stone to some\u00a0\u00a0 145.44 - more serious programming but before we get to\u00a0 that every data analyst needs a visualization\u00a0\u00a0 150.4 - tool there are dozens of BI tools out there but\u00a0 having worked for multiple companies and projects\u00a0\u00a0 156.72 - and having looked at probably hundreds of data\u00a0 analyst job openings i've come to realize that\u00a0\u00a0 161.36 - the majority of companies are looking for people\u00a0 with experience with Tableau Power BI and Qlikview\u00a0\u00a0 167.76 - here's the pros and cons of each so you can decide\u00a0 which suits you best Power BI is part of the\u00a0\u00a0 172.56 - Microsoft stack so it works smoothly with Excel\u00a0 and Sharepoint besides that it has a free version\u00a0\u00a0 178.32 - and even the paid versions are relatively budget\u00a0 friendly compared to the other BI tools next up is\u00a0\u00a0 184.0 - Tableau Tableau is a BI tool with more extensive\u00a0 data visualization capabilities than Power BI\u00a0\u00a0 190.08 - it seems to be just a bit more in demand in\u00a0 the job market than Power BI it comes with\u00a0\u00a0 195.12 - a much higher price tag though making it harder\u00a0 to learn if you're starting out by yourself and\u00a0\u00a0 199.68 - then there's Qlikview using in-memory technology\u00a0 making it a super fast and responsive way of doing\u00a0\u00a0 206.32 - business intelligence but also a pretty high price\u00a0 tag and also it's less in demand than Tableau and\u00a0\u00a0 212.56 - Power BI i personally picked Power BI as my BI\u00a0 tool although it might not be the fastest BI tool\u00a0\u00a0 217.92 - out there or the one with the most extensive\u00a0 capabilities in my opinion it can give you\u00a0\u00a0 222.24 - the most bang for buck when it comes to becoming a\u00a0 full-time data analyst before we move on to how to\u00a0\u00a0 227.84 - actually get good at data analysis and land that\u00a0 first job there's one more thing we need to do\u00a0\u00a0 232.72 - as a data analyst after you've mastered a BI tool\u00a0 it's time to get into the more advanced analytics\u00a0\u00a0 238.48 - i'm talking about which programming language\u00a0 to use when it comes to data analysis or data\u00a0\u00a0 243.6 - science software developers and programmers get to\u00a0 choose between java javascript ruby c-sharp python\u00a0\u00a0 250.88 - r c c++ and many more luckily for us data analysts\u00a0 we only have to choose between two programming\u00a0\u00a0 257.68 - languages r and python so which one should you\u00a0 pick i chose python but if i could go back in\u00a0\u00a0 264.08 - time i would choose python why well even though\u00a0 they're actually very similar r is a programming\u00a0\u00a0 270.08 - language focused more on statistical analysis\u00a0 well python is a more general purpose programming\u00a0\u00a0 276.16 - language that also happens to be very good for\u00a0 data analysis and although r might be a little\u00a0\u00a0 281.52 - bit easier to learn i would still go for python as\u00a0 it's the probably probably probably the number one\u00a0\u00a0 288.48 - programming language in the world meaning if you\u00a0 get good at python for data analysis it might also\u00a0\u00a0 293.68 - open the door to a lot of different job\u00a0 opportunities so the path i took is Excel\u00a0\u00a0 300.4 - SQL Power BI and Python this is the path i would\u00a0 recommend as it worked out great for me but you\u00a0\u00a0 306.64 - can start off with any language or tool that\u00a0 suits you best because whatever you pick your\u00a0\u00a0 311.92 - first language or tool will definitely not be your\u00a0 last so now that you know which tools to learn\u00a0\u00a0 317.52 - let's talk about how to actually learn it and\u00a0 this is where beginners make the first major\u00a0\u00a0 322.0 - mistake the mistake most beginners make is that\u00a0 they try to learn by watching others this is how\u00a0\u00a0 327.44 - most people learn data analysis some people go to\u00a0 Udemy and watch multiple 20 plus hour courses and\u00a0\u00a0 333.84 - probably not even finish all of them or they watch\u00a0 youtube videos watching other people analyze data\u00a0\u00a0 339.04 - but without actually writing code or analyzing\u00a0 data themselves they give themselves a false\u00a0\u00a0 344.16 - sense of progress because analyzing data in your\u00a0 head is very different than from actually doing it 353.6 - data analysis in your head is very different\u00a0 from actually analyzing data stumbling upon\u00a0\u00a0 359.92 - faulty data and debugging for hours so what is\u00a0 the right way to do it? the answer is very simple:\u00a0\u00a0 365.36 - learn by doing you just need to get the\u00a0 reps in and start coding and analyzing\u00a0\u00a0 369.92 - data by yourself for Excel i would recommend\u00a0 a website called www.excel-practice-online.com\u00a0\u00a0 375.76 - a free website where you learn to use Excel\u00a0 by doing from the basics to the most advanced\u00a0\u00a0 380.96 - functionalities for SQL i would recommend the\u00a0 website www.w3schools.com/sql for Power BI i\u00a0\u00a0 387.6 - would recommend Datacamp there's free courses\u00a0 and also paid ones for python you can go to\u00a0\u00a0 392.48 - this free website called learnpython.org whether\u00a0 you're practicing every day at your current job\u00a0\u00a0 398.64 - so you can make that switch to a data analysis\u00a0 career or whether you're still studying you need\u00a0\u00a0 403.44 - to practice every single day only this way will\u00a0 you experience what it's actually like working as\u00a0\u00a0 409.04 - a data analyst analysis working as a data analyst\u00a0 only then will you learn what it's like to debug\u00a0\u00a0 415.12 - your own code or formulas because to be honest\u00a0 that's what you will spend the most time on\u00a0\u00a0 420.24 - debugging faulty code or correcting faulty data\u00a0 being a data analyst is awesome but this is also\u00a0\u00a0 427.68 - the second major mistake most beginners make they\u00a0 try to solve every problem themselves the fact is\u00a0\u00a0 434.0 - that error you just got in Power BI there's a very\u00a0 big chance someone already has experienced exactly\u00a0\u00a0 439.68 - the same error as you and that's good news for you\u00a0 because now you don't have to look for the cause\u00a0\u00a0 444.16 - of the error you just have to copy part of the\u00a0 error message in google and you probably end up on\u00a0\u00a0 449.2 - some stack overflow website where someone explains\u00a0 exactly how to solve this error let's be honest\u00a0\u00a0 454.96 - copying code from stack overflow is like 80%\u00a0 of any developer programmer or data analyst job\u00a0\u00a0 462.08 - data analyst is awesome okay now that you know\u00a0 what tool and programming language to pick\u00a0\u00a0 466.8 - and how to actually learn it it's time to build\u00a0 your portfolio and this will help you build\u00a0\u00a0 471.6 - out an attractive CV for recruiters on Linkedin\u00a0 recruiters i always talk like a bit this i know\u00a0\u00a0 477.6 - programmer so strange programming language\u00a0 and recruiters talk to me every day now if\u00a0\u00a0 482.96 - you have a job where you can apply data analytics\u00a0 already then do so right away if you don't really\u00a0\u00a0 487.92 - do anything data analytics related like sales for\u00a0 example then try to build a report or a dashboard\u00a0\u00a0 494.56 - showing some key metrics or KPI's that you\u00a0 can show to your manager he will appreciate\u00a0\u00a0 499.28 - it and you will get to learn your data analysis\u00a0 skills and if you can't apply to your current job\u00a0\u00a0 503.92 - or if you're still studying then start a project\u00a0 on your own at home because in the end it's about\u00a0\u00a0 509.6 - getting that data analyst job and the best way\u00a0 to do that is as follows pimp up your Linkedin\u00a0\u00a0 515.2 - profile i've made a video before where i give\u00a0 my top five Linkedin profile tips to attract\u00a0\u00a0 520.0 - recruiters on Linkedin and i'll summarize it here\u00a0 for you make sure you put data analysts in as many\u00a0\u00a0 525.68 - places as you can in your profile Linkedin is a\u00a0 search engine and if recruiters search for data\u00a0\u00a0 530.4 - analysts you want to be found you want to be on\u00a0 top of that list so make sure your header contains\u00a0\u00a0 534.72 - the word data analyst in your work experience\u00a0 if you've done something data analyst related\u00a0\u00a0 538.64 - put in the keyword data analyst once your Linkedin\u00a0 profile is set up there's two things you can do\u00a0\u00a0 543.44 - start applying to every single data analyst\u00a0 job you can find on Linkedin or any other job\u00a0\u00a0 548.08 - platform or the second way which i prefer is if\u00a0 you've set up your Linkedin profile correctly\u00a0\u00a0 553.44 - then recruiters will soon start hunting you they\u00a0 will invite you to job interviews for data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 558.8 - positions which brings me to major mistake number\u00a0 three don't quit well do quit let me explain you\u00a0\u00a0 566.8 - see the second best decision i have ever made\u00a0 in my life was becoming a data analyst and to\u00a0\u00a0 572.96 - become one yourself the only thing you have to do\u00a0 is don't quit whether it will take you one week\u00a0\u00a0 578.72 - one month or one year if you keep applying if you\u00a0 keep improving your skills updating your CV you\u00a0\u00a0 585.28 - will land that job eventually and trust me once\u00a0 you do land that first data analyst job a world\u00a0\u00a0 591.76 - of opportunities will open up for you you can grow\u00a0 your skills into a senior data analyst or become\u00a0\u00a0 597.04 - a freelance data analyst or what i eventually\u00a0 did quit my job as a data analyst the single\u00a0\u00a0 603.28 - best decision in my life was quitting my job\u00a0 as a data analyst you see becoming a freelance\u00a0\u00a0 609.36 - data analyst gave me the resources to quit my\u00a0 job and pursue a completely different career\u00a0\u00a0 615.76 - creating my own brand while traveling the world\u00a0 do not subscribe to my youtube channel i'm 100%\u00a0\u00a0 621.2 - serious if you're looking for advice and tips on\u00a0 how to become a data analyst and how to build a\u00a0\u00a0 626.0 - data analyst career for the rest of your life then\u00a0 i would recommend subscribing to Luke Barousse\u00a0\u00a0 630.24 - what up nerds as he makes way better videos than\u00a0 me but if you view being a data analyst as a\u00a0\u00a0 636.72 - stepping stone to creating a life you want your\u00a0 dream life whatever that might be for you then\u00a0\u00a0 642.4 - you might want to subscribe as i share my personal\u00a0 lessons on this journey from a 9-5 to a dream life\u00a0\u00a0 649.12 -

let's talk about computer science 1.719 - degrees in 2024 do you need one is it 5.24 - worth it and can you actually become a 6.879 - self-taught developer in today's market 9.36 - now I'm in a unique position to make 10.759 - this video because I actually completed 12.92 - five out of eight semesters of my 14.639 - computer science degree so I know what 16.56 - the degree is like I know the type of 18.199 - things that you learn but then at the 19.72 - same time I dropped out and I was able 21.359 - to land software development positions 23.32 - afterwards I know a lot of people that 24.88 - have gone through the degree both 26.16 - successfully and unsuccessfully and at 28.279 - the same time I teach programming here 30.16 - on YouTube I have paid courses I have 32.2 - free courses and I get emails every 34.239 - single day from people telling me that 36.16 - they've landed a software development 37.64 - position yes even today in 2024 with or 41.079 - without the degree because of the type 42.64 - of things they've learned from me or 44.28 - other resources online for example I 46.68 - just had a student come out of one of my 48.039 - paid courses the one with course careers 50.0 - he landed a job in four months without a 52.199 - computer science degree and that's 54.039 - obviously going to be a bit rare not 55.44 - everyone's going to be able to do that 56.719 - but you can do this with or without a 58.44 - degree and in this video I genuinely 60.44 - just want to give you all the 61.64 - information so that you can make the 63.239 - best decision that's right for you some 65.199 - of you should get a degree some of you 66.72 - should not get a degree but you need to 68.6 - know what's involved before you make a 70.759 - very major decision that is going to 72.88 - impact the rest of your life so with 74.84 - that said let's get into it so let's get 77.32 - right into it by discussing what a 78.799 - computer science degree is not it is not 81.479 - a gateway to a really high income it is 83.4 - not a guarantee that you're going to 84.759 - have job stability or a bunch of money 87.04 - and it is definitely not something that 88.56 - teaches you everything you need to land 90.36 - a job and today in 2024 it's actually 93.04 - not a requirement for a lot of the 94.64 - different jobs that you might be 95.84 - applying for yes a lot of jobs will say 98.479 - computer science degree required but if 100.479 - you have the other requirements a lot of 102.36 - times they will look past that just to 104.28 - give you an example I have worked for a 105.88 - lot of companies where they do list 107.2 - computer science degre required but when 109.04 - they see my credentials they don't care 110.92 - and they still hire me the truth is 112.68 - people want to know that you are a good 114.159 - fit for the job as much as a computer 116.119 - science degree can help be an indicator 117.88 - of that if you can prove yourself in 119.64 - other ways often times you can get past 121.84 - that requirement I know a lot of you 123.479 - don't believe me but I see this every 125.119 - single day if you're overqualified or 127.159 - more qualified than someone that has a 128.64 - computer science degree you will still 130.599 - have a chance for a job even if it does 132.64 - list that as a requirement now with that 134.84 - in mind what is a computer science 136.519 - degree well computer science degree is a 138.56 - recognized credential it's accredited it 140.76 - looks good on your resume and there is a 142.4 - lot of jobs in other sectors that 143.959 - require some kind of 4-year degree even 146.72 - if you're not going to be working as a 148.0 - computer science now it's also gateway 150.36 - to working in Academia if you want to be 152.12 - a professor if you want to do a master's 153.84 - if you want to do anything very 155.04 - theoretical you will need a computer 157.16 - science degree another thing that a lot 159.08 - of people don't think about is that this 160.48 - is actually a requirement for a lot of 162.04 - visas if you want to go work overseas a 164.159 - lot of times you do need to have a 165.56 - bachelor's degree if you want to move to 167.36 - a country like Singapore there's 168.76 - actually a big list of requirements and 170.64 - a degree can significantly help you 172.319 - qualify for some of the different visas 174.04 - there an issue that I'm having right now 175.68 - maybe I want to move to Singapore in a 176.959 - few years it's going to be a lot more 178.48 - difficult to do that because I don't 179.68 - have have this degree obviously it's 181.76 - also required if you want to do anything 183.599 - in the math field if you want to do 185.12 - things like machine learning there is 186.959 - some specific disciplines within 188.799 - programming where it is pretty much 190.4 - mandatory to have this four-year degree 192.48 - because of the type of work that you're 194.0 - doing and the things that you're 195.28 - learning in a computer science degree 197.04 - you actually need to use in those fields 199.4 - now another thing that we can't forget a 200.799 - computer science degree is extremely 202.84 - expensive and that's what I'm going to 204.319 - be getting into in this video What It Is 206.799 - What It Isn't and where you actually get 208.959 - the value because for some of you it 210.56 - will be Roi positive but for a lot of 212.48 - you it will not so now let's get into 214.319 - some very important things that you need 215.92 - to understand about this industry 217.959 - whether you have a degree or you do not 219.599 - have a degree most of what you will 221.599 - actually be doing on the job and the 223.239 - skills that you need you will need to 224.959 - learn on your own you will learn those 226.599 - from online sources you'll probably 228.159 - learn from a lot of different sources 229.68 - whether it be a course a boot camp free 231.879 - educational material textbooks doesn't 234.159 - matter most of what you actually need to 236.519 - know the requirements that will be 238.0 - listed in a job posting you are not 240.04 - going to learn from a computer science 241.799 - degree now this is really unfortunate 243.76 - but computer science degrees are fairly 245.799 - out ofd in the degree that I did I would 248.12 - say about 25% of the material that I 250.159 - learned was actually effective and 251.959 - something that I needed on the job and 253.92 - considering how much you're paying 255.079 - considering how much time you're putting 256.359 - into it that's a pretty low percentage 258.4 - and obviously this does depend on the 259.84 - school and the type of program you go to 261.6 - I was in a very midlevel average 263.6 - computer science program probably 265.36 - familiar or similar to what a lot of you 267.08 - would end up doing or currently doing 268.88 - right now so what you you really need to 270.56 - understand here is that if you do decide 272.12 - to go get a degree that's fine but 273.8 - you're going to need to do a significant 275.12 - amount of work outside of the degree 277.16 - you're going to have to be working on 278.32 - projects you're going to have to be 279.24 - learning Frameworks you're probably 280.52 - going to have to go through other paid 282.16 - courses or material as well as the 284.6 - degree because truthfully most of the 286.639 - things that it teaches are not what you 288.56 - actually need to know to land a software 290.52 - engineering job a computer science 292.8 - degree is extremely theoretical it 295.32 - teaches you a lot of math it teaches you 297.24 - a ton of theory and you learn about a 299.039 - lot of topics that do increase your 300.88 - comprehension and your understanding but 302.72 - they don't directly translate over into 304.919 - the job so yes you may have a better 307.039 - fundamental understanding of why certain 309.039 - algorithms work the way that they do but 311.24 - you still need to learn a lot of other 313.0 - things that aren't taught in that 314.56 - program many degrees are going to 316.28 - require understanding of Frameworks 318.16 - understanding of different languages 319.68 - practical projects or actual experience 322.36 - building software and unfortunately in 324.52 - the computer science degree you really 326.199 - don't learn a lot of that in fact in my 328.68 - computer science degree again only about 330.8 - 20% of what we actually did was coding 333.479 - most of it was math you actually have to 335.16 - take a lot of other courses as 336.88 - well in my case was a ton of electives I 338.68 - had to do that had nothing to do with 340.52 - computer science and yes you do get some 342.88 - value from these topics but we do need 344.52 - to relate that back to the cost which 346.479 - we're going to talk about in a second 348.16 - now another very important thing I want 349.639 - you to understand is that the best 351.479 - developers are going to be the best 353.08 - developers whether they have a degree or 355.199 - not there's certain personality traits 357.36 - that lend themselves really well to 359.039 - being a pro programmer and there is kind 361.0 - of a bare minimum intelligence that you 362.84 - have to have if you really want to be 364.28 - successful in this field now I don't 366.28 - like to say that because generally I do 368.12 - want to encourage everyone to try this 369.919 - if they're interested in it but 371.319 - truthfully there's some people that are 372.72 - never going to be good programmers if 374.599 - you really struggle using a computer if 376.56 - you already struggle with basic math or 379.0 - this logical uh thinking reasoning is 381.44 - already a difficult skill for you 382.96 - truthfully computer science is probably 384.599 - not a path you want to go down and 386.199 - whether you have a computer science 387.639 - degree or not you're probably not going 389.24 - to be very successfully in the industry 391.28 - whereas if we look at the other end of 392.599 - the scale someone who's very intelligent 394.56 - naturally who's really good at logical 396.479 - thinking critical thinking reasoning 398.639 - they're going to be a good developer if 400.24 - they put the work in whether they have a 401.759 - degree or not they don't need one to be 403.96 - successful maybe it will make it a bit 405.919 - faster for them truthfully it probably 407.8 - wouldn't it probably be faster to go 408.919 - through the self-taught route but 410.199 - they'll be good regardless and we see 411.84 - that with some of the smartest people 413.4 - that have become very successful through 415.24 - the tech field Bill Gates Elon Musk Mark 417.72 - Zuckerberg all of these guys were 419.16 - already really good at programming 420.84 - before they got into their degrees or at 422.52 - least during the degrees and that degree 424.479 - is not the reason why they ended up 426.16 - being very successful obviously I'm 428.12 - using outliers here but I'm just trying 429.759 - to illustrate that the degree really is 431.639 - not an indication of how good of a 433.24 - programmer you're going to be there's 434.72 - certain personality traits certain 436.16 - intelligence levels and a lot of other 437.599 - character traits that will indicate that 439.599 - a lot more than Simply Having a piece of 442.039 - paper or going through some kind of 443.599 - program so now we get into costs now 445.759 - obviously we have two costs here 447.28 - financial and time on the financial side 449.56 - pretty obvious this costs a significant 451.319 - amount of money on the very very lowend 453.72 - side maybe we're paying $10,000 a year 455.879 - for tuition plus where we're living plus 458.12 - our food plus textbooks plus other 460.08 - miscellaneous expenses at University and 462.56 - on the high-end side or probably the 464.0 - average side if we go to school in the 465.319 - United States we're paying maybe $50,000 468.28 - per year if we go to a high-end or 470.039 - topend School regardless of where you go 472.639 - you're racking up tens of thousands of 474.84 - dollars in expenses through these four 476.84 - years for most of us it's going to be a 478.68 - minimum of 4 your $50,000 and 481.039 - realistically probably closer to 482.44 - $100,000 and again in the US probably 484.639 - closer to 485.879 - $200,000 that is a lot of money that we 488.52 - could spend in another place if we 490.28 - actually even had the money and for most 492.36 - of us we don't have enough to pay for 493.72 - that our parents are not financing it 495.599 - for us and that means that we are going 497.4 - to have a ton of debt debt is just a 500.039 - nightmare you don't want to start your 501.56 - life with tens or hundreds of thousands 503.36 - of dollars of debt especially when you 505.36 - don't actually have a job or you have 507.159 - absolutely no guarantee I know a lot of 509.28 - you know that but even if you do have 510.919 - all of the money we still need to 512.519 - consider time spending four years of 514.76 - your life at University is a huge 516.88 - commitment and what happens to a lot of 518.64 - people is they spend two or three years 520.08 - there like I did and then they drop out 522.08 - and they don't actually even get the 523.719 - achievement that's something you need to 525.16 - consider if you decide to commit to a 526.8 - degree like this you need to finish it 528.72 - if you spend 2 and a half years 3 years 530.72 - four years and you don't have prospects 532.72 - outside of the degree and you just 533.92 - simply don't want to do it or you're not 535.64 - capable of doing it you've just wasted a 537.6 - ton of money and time that you're never 539.64 - getting back so think about that how 541.44 - many people don't actually complete a 542.839 - computer science degree a significant 544.72 - portion I can tell you almost 50% of the 547.16 - first year class I had didn't end up 548.839 - finishing the degree or switched into a 551.079 - different program beyond that a lot of 553.519 - people aren't able to finish in four 555.0 - years takes the five years or six years 556.839 - because it's too difficult and they need 558.399 - to extend the lifespan by only doing say 560.88 - four courses per semester or three 562.6 - courses per semester it's difficult and 564.8 - now maybe you decide to add on Co-op 566.56 - maybe you take a semester Gap because 568.279 - you need a break whatever all the things 569.76 - that could happen in four years that you 571.32 - can't possibly predict and you're 572.839 - extending this even more and you're not 574.6 - making your first bit of money until 576.44 - you're 23 or 24 years old now that's the 579.519 - time commitment and you have to ask 580.959 - yourself what else could I do with four 582.959 - or five years how far could I get in my 585.44 - career whether it be in computer science 587.079 - or any other field if I didn't actually 589.48 - go through a computer science degree if 591.32 - I gave you four years and I said hey 593.0 - here's $10,000 in 4 years become a 595.56 - self-taught developer I think you're 597.2 - going to have a lot of success in that 598.839 - time frame compared to just going to 600.8 - University and like I said the issue is 603.64 - once you finish this four-year degree 605.8 - now you still need to learn a bunch of 607.76 - extra stuff to actually qualify for a 610.0 - job you have to do all the leak code you 611.88 - have to prepare for interviews you have 613.519 - to learn all of these different topics 615.04 - that weren't actually taught in the 616.36 - computer science degree unless you were 617.959 - learning it while you were doing that 619.88 - and you're equally as unprepared to get 621.8 - a job as someone who's a complete Junior 624.079 - just starting out you might know a 625.839 - little bit more but generally speaking 627.48 - you're non-expert level programmer you 629.48 - don't actually understand software 630.8 - design you haven't built a lot of real 632.56 - world projects and that's just like a 634.48 - lot of the other Junior Engineers so my 636.88 - point here is that if you do want to do 638.36 - a computer science degree it does have 640.399 - some benefits but you better be able to 641.959 - pay for it you better be knowing that 643.72 - this is the best use of your 4 years and 646.079 - while you're in the computer science 647.399 - degree you have to grind a lot to learn 649.48 - additional topics if you actually want 651.44 - the chance of Landing a job when you 653.079 - come out now with that in mind if you 654.6 - have a really clear goal on why you're 656.36 - getting this degree and you know that 657.76 - this actually is a requirement for what 659.56 - you want to do maybe you want to do 660.839 - Master's maybe you want to be a 661.92 - professor sure that probably is the best 663.959 - use of your four years and potentially 666.279 - the best use of your money the point is 668.519 - you really need to factor this and 670.0 - compare it to what else you could be 671.839 - doing with both the money and the time 674.44 - and really genuinely use some logical 676.6 - thinking here and ask yourself is this 678.8 - what I should be doing so with that in 680.68 - mind let's get into my recommendation on 682.68 - if you should or shouldn't get a 683.88 - computer science degree because some 685.48 - people should some people should not so 687.639 - now it's time for my overall 688.72 - recommendation starting for people that 690.639 - should get the degree now if you're 692.76 - someone who's not from a Western Country 694.959 - Like Us Canada UK or there's not a lot 697.639 - of job opportunities in your country 699.24 - that you actually want or that are 700.92 - attainable without a degree I'd 702.8 - recommend getting one specifically for 704.639 - immigration purposes I know for example 706.839 - if you want to work in the US a lot of 708.399 - other countries as well a degree is 710.24 - required or it's actually very 711.839 - beneficial to being able to get a 713.76 - position there so you may actually need 715.8 - one and that may be a legitimate reason 717.72 - to get a degree you need to do the 719.48 - research on that but if you are 720.72 - potentially thinking of immigrating to 722.24 - another place you probably will need one 724.48 - or it will help your chances beyond that 726.8 - if you're someone who wants to get into 727.92 - Academia if you want to be a professor 729.72 - if you want to do a PhD even in an 731.279 - unrelated field or a Ms obviously you're 733.839 - going to need a degree if you want to go 735.639 - into a very theoretical field like 737.279 - machine learning even some data science 739.32 - related fields it will be helpful to 741.76 - have the degree if you're someone who 743.92 - knows you're not going to be successful 745.48 - on your own and you really need an 747.399 - extremely structured environment where 749.24 - you're really committed because you're 750.68 - financially and time committed then go 752.56 - and do the degree for example if you 754.56 - know if you're going to spend one year 756.32 - not doing anything if you were to take 757.88 - Gap year for example then maybe it's 759.639 - smarter for you to just directly go into 761.6 - the degree there's a huge time 762.959 - commitment huge financial commitment but 764.68 - if you know yourself and you need that 766.199 - environment to learn in then maybe 767.959 - that's the best use of your time there's 769.92 - a few other exceptions where you will 771.519 - need the degree but typically speaking 773.48 - the degree is not going to be a 775.199 - prerequisite for you Landing a job and 777.639 - if you are good enough and if you are 779.16 - commed you will be able to land jobs 781.12 - without a degree will it help you yes it 783.399 - will help you a little bit for certain 785.079 - jobs but again remember what you could 787.16 - be doing in those four years that would 789.0 - help you more than having a degree in a 791.24 - lot of cases other achievements that you 793.079 - have are going to carry far more weight 795.16 - than the degree yes it is helpful but 797.519 - again we need to put a value on that is 799.199 - it $200,000 helpful is it four years of 802.24 - your time helpful in a lot of cases I 804.48 - say no unless you fit those specific 807.079 - criteria of course some other exceptions 808.92 - as well as well if you go to a very very 810.399 - high-end school if you have a 812.24 - scholarship if your parents are willing 813.839 - to pay for the entire degree for you 815.839 - then it's a lot easier to do that 817.72 - because then the cost goes down and the 819.399 - value you get goes significantly up if 821.56 - it's just four years of your time it's 823.68 - easier to get into the degree whereas if 825.399 - it's $100,000 or $25,000 of debt or 828.92 - whatever it ends up being it's 830.36 - significantly tougher to make that 831.92 - decision and justify the ROI Sur so now 834.16 - we get into my recommendation for people 835.8 - that should not get the degree if you're 837.759 - very early in life 17 18 19 first of all 841.6 - understand that you have a lot of time 843.279 - now I'm only 23 but 19 feels like it was 846.04 - so long ago for me and I really wish 848.36 - that I would have slowed down a little 849.88 - bit tried to understand myself a bit 852.079 - better and just made decisions over a 854.199 - longer period of time rather than really 856.079 - jumping into them quickly I know you 858.079 - want that momentum you want to go fast 859.92 - you want that first job but I'd highly 861.8 - recommend at least take one year as a 864.04 - gap spend that year really developing 866.44 - yourself learning a lot spend more time 868.759 - in that one year working than you would 870.24 - if you were doing a degree maybe get a 872.279 - job build up some savings and learn 874.36 - computer science and software 875.72 - engineering on the side in one year you 877.959 - can accomplish a ton especially when 879.959 - you're not distracted with something 881.44 - like a degree you can live with your 883.16 - parents and you can really set yourself 884.8 - up for life just in one or two years 887.0 - directly after high school this is the 888.959 - biggest opportunity you have young early 891.519 - in life and I would hate to see you 893.12 - waste it by immediately jumping into 894.959 - hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt 896.759 - and spending four years in a program 898.32 - that you might not finish or that's not 899.92 - going to be the best use of your time 901.759 - again if you're committed if you're 902.92 - motivated if you really want to improve 904.48 - yourself I think in one or two years of 906.079 - a gap you can really achieve a lot and a 908.36 - lot of you can land software development 910.24 - positions in that time you can make 911.959 - commitments in much less expensive 914.16 - courses for example the one that I have 916.24 - is $800 there's a lot of other great 918.24 - options out there but this isn't going 919.8 - to financially ruin you it's not this 921.88 - huge commitment for the next four or 923.519 - five years of your life and you can 925.12 - learn what you need to actually become a 927.16 - software developer and a lot of you can 929.0 - land jobs in that time now if you are 931.199 - someone who's already in a degree I 932.56 - would recommend just sticking it out but 934.639 - understanding that once you graduate 936.0 - you're not immediately going to get a 937.319 - job unfortunately for you you've made 939.44 - the commitment where yes you're now 940.68 - going to do this degree but you have to 942.279 - realize there's still a lot of other 943.759 - stuff that you need to learn and I'd 945.16 - recommend learning that at the same time 947.44 - yes I just added more work for you it 949.199 - sucks you thought going to University is 950.72 - going to teach you everything you need 951.759 - to know it's not you're going to have to 953.44 - do projects on the side you're going to 954.8 - have to learn additional stuff but if 956.399 - you want to be the best setup for when 958.079 - you graduate you need to do that while 960.04 - you're in the degree and hopefully 962.16 - before you even finish you're going to 963.319 - start having prospects because of how 965.079 - much stuff that you've learned so that's 966.44 - my overall opinion I think generally 968.519 - most people should not get the degree 970.16 - but if you have a really specific reason 971.92 - to get one then obviously go out there 974.12 - and get it I just hate seeing people 976.04 - making such a massive life-altering 977.8 - decision so early in life before even 980.04 - trying out the thing that they're going 981.279 - to be doing and also realizing after 983.24 - they get to the end of the degree they 984.72 - haven't actually learned the things they 986.36 - need to be ready for a job so I really 989.16 - warn you take your time with this don't 991.399 - feel like you need to rush into this 992.959 - decision you can always go get a 995.24 - University degree you don't need to make 997.399 - a decision that financially ruins you at 999.68 - 18 years old it's really sad to see a 1001.8 - lot of my friends are going through this 1003.199 - right now in a lot of other um different 1005.519 - degrees that aren't computer science and 1007.399 - the issue is even if they make 60 70 1009.48 - $80,000 per year they're still paying 1012.079 - such a massive amount of debt and 1014.12 - they've started life with a negative net 1016.199 - worth they're not even at the The 1017.56 - Starting Line they're behind The 1019.04 - Starting Line whereas if you decided to 1020.8 - not get the degree even if you just did 1022.759 - nothing you'd still be further ahead 1024.959 - because you have less debt right and 1026.88 - you're able to move forward you're not 1028.48 - climbing out of a hole that you've dug 1029.959 - yourself anyways that's what I think let 1032.28 - me know what your comments are in the 1033.6 - link in the description and I will see 1035.28 - you in the next one 1038.53 - [Music]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

they don't just have one server and they 25.619 - don't even have just one really big 27.0 - server rather they have hundreds 28.98 - thousands probably hundreds of thousands 31.26 - or more servers nowadays around the 33.48 - world and so when you and I go in O2 35.76 - Google or Bing and maybe type in a word 37.68 - to search for like cat it's quite 40.02 - possible that when you hit enter and 42.059 - that keyword like cats is sent over the 44.52 - internet to Google or to Bing it's 46.68 - actually spread out ultimately across 48.48 - multiple servers some of which are 50.039 - grabbing the first 10 results some of 51.66 - which are grabbing the next 10 results 52.98 - the next 10 results so that you see just 55.199 - one collection of results but a lot of 57.3 - those ideas a lot of those search 58.62 - results came from different places and 60.719 - this eliminates what could potentially 62.039 - be a bottleneck of sorts if all of the 64.619 - information you needed had to come from 66.119 - one specific server that might very well 68.159 - be busy when you have that question Nick 70.799 - asks will computer programming jobs to 73.08 - be taken over by AI within the next five 75.36 - to ten years this is such a frequently 77.159 - Asked question nowadays and I don't 78.6 - think the answer will be yes and I think 80.759 - we've seen evidence of this already in 82.56 - that early on when people were creating 84.06 - websites they were literally writing out 85.86 - code in a language called HTML by hand 88.08 - but then of course software came along 89.7 - tools like Dreamweaver that you could 91.439 - download on your own computer that would 92.88 - generate some of that same code for you 94.38 - more recently though now you can just 95.939 - sign up for websites like Squarespace 97.799 - and Wix and others whereby click click 99.72 - click and the website is generated for 101.64 - you so I dare say certainly in some 103.68 - domains that AI is really just an 105.54 - evolution of that Trend and it hasn't 107.52 - put humans out of business as much as it 109.5 - has made you and I much more productive 111.96 - AI I think and the ability soon to be 114.24 - able to program with natural language is 116.399 - just going to enhance what you and I can 118.439 - already do logically but much more 120.06 - mechanically and I think too it's worth 121.799 - considering that there's just so many 123.54 - bugs or mistakes in software in the 125.579 - world and there's so many features that 127.14 - humans wish existed in products present 129.42 - and future that are to-do list so to 131.64 - speak is way longer than will ever have 133.86 - time to finish in our lifetimes and so I 136.2 - think the prospect to having an 137.819 - artificial intelligence boost our 139.68 - productivity and work alongside us so to 142.379 - speak as we try to solve problems is 144.18 - just going to mean that you and I and 145.92 - the world together can solve so many 147.599 - more problems and move forward together 149.4 - at an even faster rate all right next up 152.16 - Sophia who asks how do microchips even 154.62 - work it's just a green piece of metal 156.599 - well here for instance we have a whole 159.0 - bunch of microchips on what's called a 160.92 - logic board or sometimes known as a 162.36 - motherboard there's a lot of ports that 164.4 - you might be familiar with for instance 165.84 - like here are some ports for audio here 167.879 - are some ports for networking here's 169.44 - some ports for USB and some other 171.0 - devices as well and those ports 172.98 - meanwhile are connected to lots of 174.72 - different chips on this board that know 176.519 - how to interpret the signals from those 178.56 - ports and perhaps the biggest chip on 180.66 - this motherboard tends to be this thing 182.099 - here called the CPU or the central 183.84 - processing unit which is really the 185.64 - brains of the computer and what you 187.26 - can't necessarily quite see because most 188.819 - of this is actually paint and not traces 190.56 - but if I flip this around you'll 192.12 - actually see in the right light and with 194.459 - the right angle a whole bunch of traces 196.8 - running up down left and right on this 198.599 - logic board that's connecting all of 200.159 - these various microchips and by Trace I 202.26 - mean a tiny little wire that's been 204.48 - etched into the top or the bottom of 206.04 - this circuit board that connects two 207.42 - parts thereon now what might these 209.22 - microchips be doing well again they 210.959 - might be simply interpreting signals 212.58 - that are coming in from these ports two 214.379 - they might be performing mathematical 215.819 - operations doing something with those 217.68 - signals in order to convert input into 219.599 - output or they might just be storing 221.64 - information ultimately in fact there's 223.26 - all different types of memory on a logic 225.12 - board like this be it Ram or ROM or the 227.76 - like and so some of those chips might 229.56 - very well be storing information for as 231.36 - long as the computer is plugged in or in 233.22 - some cases depending on the device even 235.14 - when the power goes off alright next a 237.36 - question from nkhe so if anyone can 239.459 - learn coding what do computer scientists 241.5 - do for four years in University 243.019 - typically in an undergraduate program in 245.94 - computer science or computer engineering 247.92 - or a similar field someone spends much 250.379 - more time learning about the field 252.0 - itself than about programming 253.5 - specifically so as such you might study 255.72 - not only a bit of programming but also 257.519 - mathematics certain fundamentals that 259.44 - transcend the particular classes you 261.479 - might have taken in middle school or 262.74 - high school but that can be used to 264.3 - solve Grand or real world problems you 266.4 - might learn something about networks how 268.08 - you can send information from point A to 269.759 - point B you might learn about Graphics 271.56 - how you can display things on the screen 273.36 - or even create interactive animations or 275.46 - the like you might learn how to leverage 277.139 - certain ideas from mathematics and other 279.18 - fields to implement your very own 280.62 - artificial intelligence nowadays whereby 283.32 - you use probability and statistics and 286.139 - information more generally to try to 287.88 - predict what a intelligent individual or 290.82 - in this case computer might say in 292.62 - response to a question so computer it's 294.479 - science itself is a very broad field and 296.699 - programming is really just a tool that 298.56 - you tend to learn along the way from 300.6 - Maya Shelby how do zeros and ones turn 303.24 - into the internet well I think the 305.639 - simplest answer there is that the 307.259 - internet is built upon layers and layers 309.18 - and layers of ideas and if we start at 311.34 - the lowest of those levels zeros and 313.139 - ones you have something called binary 314.52 - where zeros and ones can be used to 316.32 - represent any other numbers as well and 318.419 - if we use more and more zeros and ones 320.4 - more and more binary digits or bits so 322.8 - to speak we can count up higher and 324.24 - higher and higher and then if you and I 326.16 - agree that all right well let's not just 327.66 - use these patterns of zeros and ones to 329.699 - represent numbers what if we reserve 331.919 - some of these patterns to represent 333.24 - letters of like the English alphabet and 335.46 - then maybe you and I can decide to 336.78 - reserve certain patterns of zeros and 338.52 - ones to represent colors like red and 340.68 - green and blue in combinations thereof 342.84 - well once we have the ability to 344.16 - represent colors we could then represent 346.44 - whole pictures because what's a picture 348.12 - on your phone or a computer screen well 350.039 - it's really just a grid of dots Each of 352.56 - which has its own color so this is all 354.479 - to say that even if we start at this 355.919 - lowest level of just zeros and ones so 358.139 - long as you and I and all of the devices 360.419 - we use agree to follow some standard 362.52 - like this we can build these layers and 364.5 - layers of abstraction so to speak on top 366.84 - of one another until finally you and I 369.0 - come up with a pattern of zeros and ones 370.8 - that represents send this piece of of 372.78 - information from me over there and thus 375.479 - we have something like the internet 377.22 - Majin Buu asks can someone that knows 379.74 - computer science explain to me why 381.24 - computers use binary coding and not 383.28 - trinary when trinary is supposed to be 385.38 - faster so it's not necessarily the case 387.12 - that a trinary system which would use 389.16 - three symbols for instance zero one and 391.44 - two would necessarily be faster than 393.84 - binary because binary using just zero 396.12 - and one tends to be simpler to implement 398.16 - and also more robust to potential errors 400.68 - or if you're familiar with voltage 402.12 - levels like in a battery it's very easy 404.1 - for a computer to distinguish something 405.6 - for like zero volts or three volts but 408.36 - it gets a little harder if we try to 410.039 - draw the line somewhere in between 411.6 - because there's just a higher 412.979 - probability that a computer might 414.78 - mistake a a voltage level like 1.5 in 417.539 - the middle is maybe being a little 418.74 - closer to off than on or to on than off 422.16 - here too is where even though there 423.96 - might be mathematical efficiencies in 425.52 - real world efficiencies to using trinary 427.86 - otherwise known as ternary like a zero a 430.319 - one and a two digit instead of just 432.12 - zeros and ones it turns out because our 434.34 - world runs on electricity nowadays and 436.259 - there's so much momentum behind binary 437.699 - that it just tends to be a net positive 440.099 - Rachel P95 asks why is every Windows 443.52 - solution have you tried restarting and 445.74 - why does that always work so that's a 447.66 - very heavy-handed solution to what are 449.46 - typically just bugs or mistakes in 451.38 - software for instance windows in this 453.24 - case restarting a computer just starts 455.4 - everything from scratch so all of the 457.08 - computers short-term memory is lost and 459.3 - everything starts in pristine condition 460.86 - which is to say that it starts in 462.539 - exactly the way that the programmers at 464.16 - Microsoft intended without potentially 466.319 - the distractions of the computer being 467.819 - in some weird state or condition that 469.8 - the programmers just didn't anticipate 471.479 - maybe you clicked on some buttons in a 473.039 - weird order maybe you opened a strange 474.72 - file but you maybe you got the computer 476.46 - into a state that just wasn't programmed 478.56 - for properly Jason Whitmer now asks 480.78 - what's the best operating system well 482.58 - this is one of these questions in 483.72 - Computing we would call a religious 485.46 - question since it evokes a religious 487.319 - debate as to which might be best of 488.94 - course among the most popular operating 490.38 - systems out there are windows and Mac OS 493.259 - but there's also one you might not have 494.819 - heard of which is called Linux which is 496.5 - actually very omnipresent in the 498.419 - Enterprise world so many of today's 499.8 - servers actually run Linux so many of 501.78 - today's desktops or laptops though run 503.639 - Windows or Mac OS now that's not to say 506.16 - you couldn't run all of those operating 507.72 - systems in different contexts and some 509.34 - of us do actually run Linux on our own 511.02 - computers so a lot of it is really boils 513.539 - down to personal preference I wouldn't 515.219 - even say that there's one best operating 517.02 - system but there tend to be correlations 519.18 - between the operating systems people use 521.159 - and the applications they have in mind 522.959 - so windows for instance is so popular in 525.06 - the world of PCS and desktops and 526.74 - laptops Mac OS is to some extent 528.839 - particularly in Academia in certain 530.58 - countries but not necessarily on the 532.44 - same scale Linux by contrast is again 534.42 - very much used heavily in the 536.1 - server-side industry but so is Windows 538.2 - as well so a lot of the choice for 540.18 - operating systems sometimes comes from 542.04 - just what's most appropriate what's most 544.019 - popular what's most supportive but some 545.94 - of it comes too from just personal 547.26 - preference of the engineer maybe the 548.94 - first engineer that you hire to make one 550.74 - of those decisions so it's more about 552.06 - what what's best for you and not so much 554.22 - best in general next Julio magnifico 557.1 - asks why aren't computers getting 558.66 - cheaper well computers or at least 560.7 - computer parts inside of computers do 563.399 - tend to get cheaper the catch is that 565.44 - your expectations and my expectations 567.36 - just keep Rising we want our phones our 569.7 - laptops our desktops to do more and more 571.56 - in the way of the software that they run 573.36 - the games that we use and just how 575.279 - quickly they perform for us so even 577.019 - though some of those parts are getting 578.459 - less expensive you and I want them to do 581.1 - more and more and be faster and larger 583.14 - in quantity and so as a result I dare 585.54 - say that the price isn't going down as 587.76 - far as you might hope that said nowadays 589.98 - you can get for the same amount of money 591.72 - from yesteryear much much more in the 594.0 - way of computing power so arguably it's 596.64 - working to our benefit in some cases 598.62 - next up from Darrow nabila can someone 601.019 - explain cloud computing to me like a 603.12 - five-year-old cloud computing is 604.98 - essentially you using someone else's 606.959 - servers that someone is paying to rent 609.06 - for instance or timeshare so this isn't 611.16 - really a new idea or or new technology 613.08 - rather it's a better branding of a 615.12 - technique that's been used for years not 616.86 - just in the computer world but in the 618.18 - real world as well whereby someone like 619.8 - Google or Microsoft or apple or others 621.959 - nowadays might be able to afford lots 624.0 - and lots and lots of servers and then 625.56 - make those servers available in part to 627.899 - me to you and many other customers as 630.06 - well hey I'm Marcus hey Marcus well 632.64 - Marcus asks how does computer memory 634.86 - work think of computer memory as really 637.08 - being driven by a whole bunch of 638.279 - switches that can either be turned on 639.959 - and off so for instance if I take this 642.12 - here light switch which is currently off 644.1 - I could simply say that this switch here 646.5 - is representing the number zero in 648.6 - binary but if I turn the switch on well 650.7 - now I can say that I'm representing the 652.5 - number one now of course I can only 654.54 - count as high as 0 to 1 with a single 657.06 - light switch but what if I bring over a 659.519 - second light switch like this one here 661.68 - if we start at zero in this way turn on 664.86 - this switch first and claim that it's 666.839 - one let me now be more creative and turn 669.0 - this one off and this one on and now 671.459 - claim this is how how a computer's 673.079 - memory could represent the number two 674.519 - and now if I turn this switch back on 676.74 - giving me a fourth pattern this is how I 679.5 - might represent the number three now of 681.54 - course if we add more and more of these 682.98 - switches more and more of these light 684.36 - bulbs we can count even higher than 686.16 - three and indeed that's what a 687.779 - computer's memory is ultimately doing 689.64 - it's using lots and lots of little tiny 692.04 - switches otherwise known as transistors 694.14 - to turn the flow of electricity on and 696.18 - off and then it's got other types of 697.86 - Hardware called for instance capacitors 700.14 - that have a capacity to hold on to some 702.24 - of that electricity just like the light 704.04 - bulb there being on all right next 706.26 - Donnie asks how do you explain web 3 to 709.019 - people so web3 like web 2 and 712.38 - retrospectively web one or really just 714.12 - buzzwords that describe sort of phases 716.519 - of the internet or the World Wide Web as 718.44 - you and I know it for instance back in 720.24 - the day when there was just the World 721.92 - Wide Web now perhaps referred to as web 724.5 - version one information was largely 726.54 - static if you were to create a website 728.579 - on the internet you would type up your 730.5 - code you would type up your content you 731.94 - would put it on a server somewhere and 733.92 - someone could read that information but 736.14 - it was you the web developer or you the 739.079 - owner of the website that was creating 740.579 - that content for other people to 742.56 - actually read and consume in web 2 the 744.839 - world became much more dynamic in recent 747.0 - years whereby now websites tend to have 749.279 - databases and they have more 751.2 - sophistication so that a lot of the 753.18 - content in websites today are actually 755.16 - coming from me and from you so if you 757.32 - think of any social media site it's not 759.3 - the owners of those sites that are 760.62 - creating most of the content it's you 762.3 - and me as the users of those same 764.519 - websites but in web 2 everything is 766.74 - nonetheless very centralized whether 768.54 - you're Twitter or Facebook now meta or 770.7 - other companies all of that data even in 772.8 - the world of social media that's coming 774.54 - from me and you is actually being stored 776.639 - centrally on those company servers so 778.98 - web 3.0 or web 3 so to speak is really 782.22 - about transitioning away potentially 784.079 - from that very centralized model to one 786.839 - that's more distributed where the data 788.76 - that you and I are creating whereby the 790.68 - data you and I are consuming is actually 792.779 - distributed over multiple servers over a 795.54 - technique called blockchain for instance 797.459 - in some cases whereby there's not 799.2 - necessarily one owner of that data but 801.959 - really Collective ownership and 803.639 - therefore verification that the data 805.62 - Maybe indeed came from me and you next a 809.04 - question from gomo tigers can someone 810.839 - explain to me the difference between 812.339 - firmware and software Hardware is 814.56 - physical software is code WTF is 817.56 - firmware firmware is really a synonym 819.54 - for a type of software so firmware is 821.7 - just software but it tends to be 823.079 - software that comes built into your 826.019 - hardware and you can think of in the 828.0 - simplest scenario that firmware is 829.92 - software that is just completely 831.779 - integrated into the hardware and itself 833.519 - cannot be changed or even upgraded but 835.5 - that's a bit of an oversimplification 837.12 - because even firmware typically when it 839.519 - comes in a computer when it comes in a 841.32 - phone or some other device can very 843.06 - often be updated why because the 845.22 - firmware is the software that's really 846.779 - closest to the hardware and in that 848.519 - sense it might very well be the most 849.839 - important and if anything goes wrong 851.519 - with The Firm where you might not even 852.899 - be able to turn that device on whether 854.399 - it's a phone or computer or even your 856.079 - refrigerator nowadays alright that's all 858.3 - the questions for today we hoped you 859.68 - learned a little something along the way 861.0 - we'll see you next time 862.79 - [Music]"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

you need to acquire? 19.176 - And how to acquire them? 20.591 - You will find the answer to that in this video. 22.341 - These skills are not randomly chosen. 24.606 - I found them after reading the India Skills Report 2024. 29.076 - This report has been created by Wheebox 30.785 - in partnership with AICTE and Google. 33.398 - In simple words, it's a highly reputed and 35.398 - credible report spanning 147 pages. 38.738 - After thoroughly reading it, I've identified top 5 skills 42.649 - as well as how to learn them. 44.351 - Talking about those top 5 skills, the first is 'Data Analysis'. 48.855 - Within this, there are 5 specific tools you need to learn.  52.82 - I'm listing their names here: 54.825 - Python, R programming, SQL, Hadoop, and Spark. 58.582 - Before moving forward, let me clarify that 60.552 - I don't have a tech background. 62.363 - In fact, I come from a commerce background 63.946 - and have completed my MBA. 65.366 - So, if I make any mistakes while explaining 67.906 - something related to tech, 69.369 - you can correct me in the comments of this video. 71.556 - The demand for data analysis and data science 73.921 - has increased so much in the market that 75.726 - according to report by LinkedIn, it was mentioned that 77.345 - the data analyst is going to be one of those jobs 80.106 - in the future with the highest hiring. 82.421 - So, where can one learn these skills? 84.334 - I've found 3 courses that cover all 5 of these aspects. 88.766 - The first course is IBM's specialization called 91.802 - the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. 94.327 - The second one is also a professional certification 96.388 - called IBM Data Analyst with Excel and R. 99.271 - And the third course is on the Udemy platform. 101.928 - Its name is \"Spark, SQL and Hadoop.\" 104.85 - Out of these, the third course is paid, 106.841 - priced around Rs. 499/- 108.647 - while the first two courses can be audited for free. 111.144 - If you don't have a background in data analysis, 113.35 - then I would recommend starting with the first one. 116.111 - It doesn't require any computer science background. 119.483 - It will start from the very basics. 121.073 - Let's move towards our second skill, named 123.751 - 'Project Management', especially in the field of AI. 127.162 - Project management is one of those fields where 129.874 - an 18% growth rate has been observed, especially 132.514 - for those with a non-technical background such as 134.047 - MBA graduates, for them, this field will become 136.639 - very interesting in the future because as AI emerges, 140.291 - it will become very very difficult 142.291 - to manage complex projects with AI. 144.529 - So you will need to learn a lot of things, 146.72 - like how to gather resources, 148.393 - coordinate with teams and assess risks. 151.134 - To learn all these things, we will pursue a course. 154.705 - And along with that, I will recommend you a tool 157.057 - which will help you learn easily. 158.761 - The course is quite reputable. 160.135 - You can find it on the Coursera platform. 162.35 - It's Google's Project Management Certification. 164.809 - Through this entire course, you will learn everything 167.105 - about project management from A to Z. 169.038 - In fact, I have selected it because 171.042 - it also includes a 'Capstone' project at the end. 173.269 - Project management is a skill that 175.086 - you cannot learn without practicing. 177.256 - Theoretical knowledge alone is not sufficient. 179.635 - So I would recommend you a tool; It is called 'Odoo'.  182.635 - In Odoo, there is a project app. 184.282 - Go to the Odoo website, click on the project app, 187.322 - and you can see that this first app is free forever. 190.0 - We'll click on 'New Project' here. 191.914 - You can give any name you want, 193.162 - for example, 'Your Weekly To-Do List.' 195.0 - After that, you add stages like 196.912 - 'Yet to Begin,' 'Ongoing,' and 'Completed'. 199.36 - Let's start adding tasks now. 200.944 - For example, grocery shopping, 202.783 - studying, assignments, meetings, etc. 205.127 - You can also give these tasks a deadline. 207.045 - For example, I want to be done with my assignments 209.285 - in the next three days. 210.295 - As you can see here, it says 'in 3 days' to indicate 213.53 - by when this task needs to be completed. 215.448 - You can add time sheets; this option is in settings. 218.217 - You can assign the number of hours 220.299 - you want to dedicate to a particular task. 222.501 - Let's say I want to allocate 15 hours 224.918 - for studying this week. 226.213 - Then, as soon as you start that task, 228.375 - you can move it from 'Yet to Begin' to 'Ongoing' stage, 231.572 - and even change its color code by altering the status. 234.429 - Then you can also lock your time, 236.348 - for example, on this day, I spent 4 hours studying. 239.503 - As I keep recording like this, I'll be able to see how 242.957 - much time I've spent compared to the estimated time, 245.845 - so I can track where my time is going. 248.009 - This way, you can manage several projects, 250.322 - such as your study hours or work-related tasks, 253.884 - finance, freelancing, etc. 255.591 - So what will happen is that you can monitor 257.563 - any one project closely. 259.44 - This will teach you basic skill of project management 262.489 - that you can further utilize in handling complex projects. 265.739 - The third skill we'll discuss is AI Ethics and Bias. 269.339 - Basically, what's happening is that as AI is emerging, 272.235 - there are many laws and ethical considerations 274.875 - regarding how to use it, 276.388 - many developments are happening in this regard. 278.353 - So, if you get to learn this skill, 280.105 - it's been seeing remarkable growth in the industry, 283.02 - almost a 20% growth rate. 284.886 - After learning this skill, the basic thing that you'll get, 288.312 - which others might not have, will be digital fluency, 291.713 - meaning how you can use AI ethically. 295.001 - There are many tools available for this, 296.992 - such as courses, guidelines, case studies. 300.136 - In fact, I want to share something with you 302.244 - that you might not know which is that 304.354 - the Government of India has its own national portal for AI. 308.828 - In this, you will find all the initiatives by 310.552 - the Government of India related to AI, 312.419 - or any latest updates coming in the industry, 315.271 - everything will be available here. 316.669 - In fact, I would recommend that 318.156 - you check out its resources section. 320.233 - There you will find case studies and learning activities. 323.713 - If you delve into learning, they have recommended 326.153 - quite a few courses that you can take. 328.206 - But I would recommend you the last resource, which is  330.758 - this course from the University of Helsinki. 333.035 - When you click on it, 334.318 - they will redirect you to a very, very simple website 337.487 - where you don't need to login or do anything, 340.098 - everything is in text form. 342.192 - I found this website very good because 344.314 - they have explained AI basics, ethics, 347.732 - everything very well step by step inside it. 350.928 - In fact, they have tried to explain in such a simple form, 354.768 - using pictures and diagrams, 356.965 - so that even if you are from a non-tech background, 359.57 - you can still learn these things. 361.296 - The fourth skill I'll talk about is Cyber Security. 364.351 - I mentioned it in a previous video as well 366.877 - because cyber attacks have increased significantly. 369.178 - It is important for every single person to know 371.935 - how to keep themselves secure online, 374.322 - but even more so if you want to enter this field, 377.368 - there are remarkable job opportunities. 379.552 - For this, the professional certification you can pursue 381.869 - is being offered by Microsoft. 383.84 - It will help you in becoming a cyber security analyst,  387.54 - and you can also do it through the Coursera website. 390.145 - In the previous video I made, 391.646 - I recommended a quite basic course. 394.115 - But the courses I'm mentioning in this video will 396.933 - actually help you acquire high-paying jobs in those 400.779 - roles because these are all professional certifications. 404.122 - Along with that, I'll also provide you with a handbook. 406.484 - Suppose you want to learn the basics of cybersecurity. 410.226 - In that case, the Government of India has created 412.824 - a handbook for students. 414.896 - You can use it to protect yourself as well. 416.6 - If you think; your interest is growing in cybersecurity, 419.828 - in that case, you can pursue that Microsoft certification. 423.232 - Our final skill is that of communication. 425.597 - Let me tell you something very interesting. 427.866 - Globally, out of all the countries, 429.725 - India has the 2nd largest population of English speakers. 433.705 - But the problem is that 435.0 - our proficiency and fluency are not as good. 437.953 - So if tomorrow you go for any interview, 440.435 - want to enter any job which deals globally, 443.715 - which is the case nowadays with most organizations, 446.577 - you need to have a very solid command over English. 449.922 - Firstly, you can use this website from Cambridge. 453.039 - So for those who want to start with the basics, 455.411 - this website is good for them. 457.213 - Apart from that, I'll tell you about a technique called 460.163 - 'Choral Reading' or 'Imitation Technique'. 463.048 - If you want to practice English in an Indian accent, 466.099 - in that case, there is a channel called English Speeches. 468.559 - In its playlist section, there are many speeches given 472.161 - that Indians have delivered in English. 474.262 - For example, there is a speech by Priyanka Chopra. 476.867 - The best part of this speech is that 478.724 - they add very large subtitles. 481.033 - How can you use imitation technique in this? 483.789 - You listen to one line, press pause, repeat the same, 487.849 - then listen again, pause again. 490.308 - There are almost 80 videos like this in this playlist. 492.834 - And if you practice even one video every day, 495.536 - your English fluency will improve significantly. 497.91 - In addition to this, I was also planning 499.91 - to make a proper video on communication. 502.184 - So I will surely make it in the next month. 503.927 - But I hope that you find this video helpful. 506.651 - That you gain some skills to learn. 508.028 - If you want more videos like these on skills or jobs, 511.171 - please do leave a comment. 512.371 - So that I can receive feedback. 513.762 - And you can subscribe to the channel for more. 515.602 - Thank you so much for watching this video, guys. 517.328 - And see you the next time."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction and Job Market Overview 0:19 - Top Skills Based on India Skills Report 2024 0:45 - Skill 1: Data Analysis and Tools to Learn 1:31 - Where to Learn Data Analysis Skills 2:01 - Skill 2: Project Management in AI 2:55 - Tools and Resources for Project Management 3:59 - Skill 3: AI Ethics and Bias 4:53 - Learning Resources for AI Ethics 5:36 - Skill 4: Cybersecurity and Certifications 6:27 - Skill 5: Communication and English Fluency"}]}

35.469 - Entrepreneurs pop-up in all types of industries and can have widely different backgrounds. 39.98 - Some build personal brands, while others work tirelessly on a physical product they believe in. 46.1 - Really, anyone can be an entrepreneur, given an idea and the right tools to develop it 50.989 - into a functional business. 52.94 - Together, we\u2019ll develop our business acumen and learn the importance of grit, determination, 58.73 - and a fair bit of luck. 59.97 - I\u2019m Anna Akana, and this is Crash Course Business: Entrepreneurship. 63.8 - [Opening Music Plays] 72.52 - Some people define an entrepreneur with buzzwords like \u201ctrailblazing,\u201d \u201cinnovative,\u201d 76.689 - \u201cproblem-solving,\u201d \u201cpassionate,\u201d and on and on. 79.13 - These might all be traits that entrepreneurs can strive for. 82.499 - But, at its core, an entrepreneur is someone who sees a need and takes on the financial 88.029 - risk to start a business to fill that need. 91.189 - That may sound kind of vague, but that\u2019s kind of the point. 94.88 - There\u2019s no cookie-cutter entrepreneur. 97.34 - Unless you, like, start a business to sell cookie cutters. 99.599 - In which case, yes, there is a cookie-cutter entrepreneur. 102.249 - Your idea might take the form of a physical product with a physical store -- called a 106.17 - brick and mortar business. 108.509 - In Montana, Charlie and Barbie Beaton of Big Dipper Ice Cream 111.749 - took their passion for locally made ice cream from one shop in downtown Missoula to appearing 117.109 - on Good Morning America. 118.649 - Daaaaaamn. 119.649 - Or instead of a tangible product, your venture might be a national empowerment network. 124.329 - GirlBoss New Zealand was founded by 20-year-old Alexia Hilbertidou after she was the only 129.82 - woman in her upper-level physics class. 132.41 - Her goal is encouraging high-school-age women to pursue STEM and leadership careers. 137.209 - Or you might set your sights on an international online media empire, like Arianna Huffington, 142.379 - the founder and namesake of HuffPost. 145.23 - She founded her site (with partners) as a friendly alternative to news aggregators. 150.59 - And she eventually sold it to AOL in 2015 for $315 million US dollars. 158.18 - Get it, Ari. 159.18 - It\u2019s clear that entrepreneurs come in all flavors. 160.94 - I mean, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, over 100 million businesses are launched 167.219 - each year. 168.28 - That\u2019s 11,000 per hour or 3 new businesses per second. 173.24 - ...There they go! 174.049 - So instead of just defining who is an entrepreneur, since it is such a wide scope - we can instead 179.3 - narrow down our definition by understanding who isn\u2019t one. 182.599 - Let\u2019s go to the Thought Bubble. 185.03 - Say Congress works for Me-Wow, a feline health and fitness company. 189.379 - He notices a need -- a shocking lack of cat transportation -- and comes up with the idea 194.43 - for the Cat-Cycle, which he pitches to his boss. 197.819 - Me-Wow immediately sends the Cat-Cycle into production because it\u2019s a genius idea, obvi 202.62 - and it flies off the shelves. 205.069 - Even though Congress is using an entrepreneurial mindset, by our definition, he isn\u2019t an 209.629 - entrepreneur yet. 211.28 - The company Me-Wow actually took the financial risk to develop, produce, and sell the Cat-Cycle. 217.75 - Meanwhile, Beetle sees the same need for cat transportation and sketches out the Cat-Board 223.079 - in his personal idea notebook after work. 225.989 - He\u2019s gained valuable experience working for Me-Wow and develops the Cat-Board in the 230.75 - evenings and on weekends before striking out on his own. 234.92 - Using his personal savings, Beetle commissions a prototype that he shops around to local 239.65 - stores. 240.65 - A few are interested and he sets up contracts with them. 243.819 - As his sales begin to grow, Beetle creates new designs, but he doesn\u2019t pay attention 248.959 - to what his customers like or dislike about the Cat-Board. 252.829 - Because he failed to make valuable improvements to the Cat-Board for his customers, sales 257.72 - plummet. 258.72 - It\u2019s a tough decision, but Beetle cuts his losses and sells his Cat-Board designs to 263.58 - Me-Wow, which revamps his idea as the Dog-Board. 267.259 - Beetle is an entrepreneur because he saw a need and 270.75 - took the financial risk to fill it! 272.7 - It didn\u2019t go so well because he didn\u2019t incorporate customer feedback. 276.35 - But now he knows where he went wrong and won\u2019t make the same mistake in his next entrepreneurial 281.78 - endeavor. 282.78 - Thanks Thought Bubble! 283.78 - For a while, the classic story of an entrepreneur was someone who created one business that 288.069 - became a long-term project, 289.43 - like opening a new restaurant or founding a tech startup to make flashy phone games. 293.91 - But that\u2019s not the whole picture anymore. 296.13 - There\u2019s been a shift in the global job market that has opened the door for entrepreneurship 301.03 - to become more mainstream. 302.85 - Specifically, I\u2019m talking about the rise of the Gig Economy. 307.12 - Contract work, called gigging, is becoming more popular and taking up more of the labor 311.819 - market. 312.819 - And I don\u2019t just mean gigs like musicians and comedians hopping between open mic nights. 317.0 - Instead of a long-term relationship where employees are paid salaries by the hour or 321.81 - year, businesses are temporarily hiring people for specific projects. 326.22 - This shift has made it financially easier for entrepreneurs to find people to get their 331.05 - businesses going, without committing long-term to paying employees. 335.05 - And it\u2019s allowed early-stage entrepreneurs to find flexible work to support themselves 340.789 - as they develop their product or service. 342.69 - This doesn\u2019t mean everyone in the gig economy is an entrepreneur, it\u2019s just given more 347.74 - people the opportunity. 349.28 - So a more traditional path might be joining an accounting firm right after college and 353.77 - working 9 to 5, Monday to Friday until you retire. 357.41 - Or die of boredom. 358.9 - Spreadsheets? 359.9 - For LIFE?? 360.9 - NO THANKS 361.9 - Some people might feel fulfilled with that kind of steady employment. 363.699 - And the stability that comes from being a salaried employee with health insurance can 367.419 - be incredibly valuable. 369.44 - Others, like us entrepreneurs, might itch for more independence. 373.74 - In the gig economy, you could have a couple ways to make money, in addition to or instead 378.56 - of that 9-to-5 job. 380.53 - And you can go online to look for gigs from anywhere -- not just your real-life community. 386.139 - So you might consult for a network of women small business owners on their day-to-day 390.43 - accounting, create vlogs with tax software tips, and sell unicorn knit hats on Etsy that are knit out of the softest fabric there is. 400.34 - On the plus side, this allows workers to build robust portfolios of work and find fulfilling 406.039 - gigs. 407.039 - Having separate jobs can also provide a stronger sense of income security than one full-time 411.65 - job. 412.65 - Even if you lose one, you\u2019re still making money. 414.52 - All hail the side-hustle! 416.29 - Today\u2019s entrepreneurs are well-suited for the gig economy because we know how to hustle. 420.919 - We\u2019re independent thinkers who are comfortable with developing our own diverse income streams, 426.229 - marketing ourselves, and connecting with others. 428.2 - I mean, who hasn\u2019t had a Lyft driver who moonlights as a cinnamon roll artisan, right? 433.4 - But there are still problems with the gig lifestyle. 436.87 - Sure, someone might become a Lyft driver to help fund their sugary dream. 441.28 - But they\u2019re almost certainly not doing it because driving strangers around is their 445.449 - passion. 446.449 - For some people, participating in the gig economy is a necessity, not a choice. 451.47 - Scrambling to pay rent and afford food is another reason to have a bunch of gigs. 455.68 - And, depending on the country and government, gig workers can have fewer legal protections 460.86 - - like mandatory breaks and standardized pay -- or they might have a harder time maintaining 466.009 - insurance and retirement accounts. 467.789 - This makes some countries more attractive to entrepreneurs, such as New Zealand, Singapore, 472.599 - and Denmark, based on The World Bank\u2019s annual analysis of the \u201cEase of Doing Business.\u201d 476.58 - But even in those countries, there\u2019s a difference between legally being able to take a break 481.75 - and actually taking a break. 484.09 - It can be a struggle to turn off the hustle -- especially for those of us trying to create 488.0 - a personal brand with our art or online presence. 491.66 - But taking time for fun hobbies and spending time with friends and family are important 497.28 - parts of being successful, and so necessary to stay mentally healthy. Trust me! 502.889 - So it\u2019s not all blue skies and rainbows. 505.11 - But if you ever wanted to be an entrepreneur, the gig economy has made it more possible 509.599 - now than ever. 510.78 - Even still, entrepreneurship isn\u2019t easy. 513.37 - Taking a financial gamble is stressful, and so is working long hours to try and get a 518.77 - project off the ground. 520.2 - I know for me, the lack of structured work time often means that my business has no off 525.08 - time. 526.08 - And if I\u2019m not careful, I can work around the clock and get myself exhausted. 530.21 - But tons of us take the leap to start a new business and stick with it through the ups 534.88 - and downs, so what exactly keeps us motivated? 539.22 - At the top of the list is freedom. 543.0 - Entrepreneurs get to be their own bosses. 545.25 - This can mean setting your own hours and deciding on dress codes... or lack thereof. 550.25 - Sweatpants all day everyday amirite? 552.64 - Maybe you want to work from bed or while you travel, writing emails by a pool. 557.1 - And for traditionally underrepresented groups in business like women, people of color, or 561.88 - the LGBTQ community, ding ding ding, I am all those things. It can mean defining 566.86 - your own destiny. 568.3 - You can create an inclusive company culture and work environment, rather than feeling 573.19 - stuck in an uncomfortable -- or even possibly illegal -- situation with a boss or coworker. 578.9 - If someone keeps talking over you and dismissively says women can\u2019t be funny, you don\u2019t need 583.77 - to hire them for your writer\u2019s room or film set. 585.58 - Or if a coworker from a previous job got fired for having a natural hairstyle, you can create 590.97 - a business where that would never happen. 594.08 - You wield the power. 595.08 - A study in the Social Science Research Network journal found that entrepreneurs start companies 600.71 - because they mostly believe that: 603.27 - They are inherently more valuable than how they appear on paper. 607.28 - They are wasted working for someone else 610.71 - Their resumes don\u2019t show \u201cthe real them\u201d 614.54 - Large companies can\u2019t appreciate their full potential. 617.97 - And They are capable of turning their internal 621.28 - value into real life money. 624.13 - Basically, entrepreneurs believe in themselves. 626.77 - And sure, building self-confidence over time isn\u2019t always easy, but it can be a powerful 631.76 - motivator. 632.76 - And then, there\u2019s potential wealth. 634.92 - Yes, there\u2019s financial risk in starting a business, but there\u2019s money in running 639.17 - a successful one. 641.05 - Entrepreneurial lore is full of rags-to-riches tales, where people pitch the next SnapChat 645.5 - and are launched into the business stratosphere. 647.79 - Like, Oprah Winfrey has said she spent her early childhood wearing overalls made of potato 653.69 - sacks. 654.69 - But she became North America\u2019s first black multi-billionaire and \u201cQueen of the Daytime 660.79 - Talkshow.\u201d 661.79 - Sure, this is the stuff of inspirational posters, and not everyone can make it this big. 667.5 - But entrepreneurship does create a culture of opportunity that might work for some non-traditional 673.42 - workers. 674.42 - Of course, every entrepreneur with a massive success has also had hundreds of failures. 680.27 - Yep, the dreaded F word. 682.08 - Lean Startup methodology is basically the globally recognized guidebook for entrepreneurs 686.89 - created by Steve Blank and Eric Ries. 689.79 - And it says stumbling is perfectly fine if we learn as we go. 695.76 - But to identify and learn from failures, every entrepreneur has to ask themselves: what does 701.55 - success look like to me? 703.61 - Is it earning $30,000 a year in your food truck and skiing every weekend? 708.66 - Is it selling your idea for a million dollars? 711.03 - Is it becoming the CEO of a mid-size media production company and writing novels on the 716.37 - side? 717.37 - Thanks for hiring us, Hank! 718.45 - Also where is the sequel and when can I star in the movie adaptation? 721.62 - Or is it owning 6 cats and producing your own films? 725.75 - Whatever success is, it\u2019s entirely up to you. 728.64 - Of course no one wants to fail. 730.87 - But together we\u2019ll learn how to redefine failure and pick up the pieces if it\u2019s truly 735.61 - unavoidable. 736.61 - It\u2019s not that successful entrepreneurs never faced failure; it\u2019s that they didn\u2019t quit. 741.53 - So the bottom line is /anyone/ can be an entrepreneur with a little grit, determination, and luck. 747.2 - And remember, you may have stopped believing in unicorns, but they\u2019ve never stopped believing 753.11 - in you. 754.11 - Next time, we\u2019ll talk about that fundamental piece at the core of any entrepreneur: their 758.781 - ideas -- where ideas come from, who to take them to, and how to turn them into feasible businesses. 765.18 - Thanks for watching Crash Course Business.

if College were a video game a major 8.94 - would be like the main storyline sure 11.4 - there are plenty of side quests 12.9 - surprises and achievements to earn but a 15.42 - major give us an overall route where we 17.82 - take classes to reach significant plot 19.439 - points and checkpoints and save points 21.18 - hopefully lots of save points it's a 23.1 - major choice and a pretty important one 25.439 - so students tend to put a lot of thought 27.48 - into it that can be a hard thing to 28.98 - figure out on your own spending too much 30.9 - time in a major that isn't the right fit 32.7 - for you can waste time and money luckily 34.8 - you have us hi I'm Erica brazovsky and 37.32 - this is Crash Course how to college a 39.42 - study hall series presented in 40.68 - partnership with Arizona State 41.879 - University today we're going to talk 43.86 - about how to decide what to dedicate 45.539 - your entire life to just kidding that 47.82 - would probably take a lot longer than 10 49.739 - minutes but we are going to talk about 51.719 - how to decide what to spend your college 53.699 - life doing 57.14 - [Music] 62.399 - in college there are hundreds sometimes 64.559 - even thousands of different classes to 66.479 - choose from so with such a long list of 69.0 - possibilities colleges build in some 70.979 - structure to help us Wade through and 72.72 - create our own unique Journeys for 74.7 - instance most colleges require students 76.74 - to pick a major which is a student's 78.72 - intended area of study when we choose a 80.7 - major we take a set of classes that help 82.38 - us specialize our knowledge in a 83.58 - particular discipline field career or 85.68 - skill set our major becomes a guide for 88.08 - what classes we take and where and how 90.0 - we spend our time in fact a major is 92.28 - really what we get a degree in so on our 94.92 - diplomas it might say Bachelors of 96.42 - linguistics or Associates in nursing 98.1 - like my major was Linguistics so I 100.079 - focused on English sociolinguistics and 102.0 - learn skills and knowledge that I could 103.32 - use in a future career and this is true 105.659 - for all different types of Majors 107.1 - Finance Majors learn to analyze budgets 109.14 - and investment strategies English Majors 111.299 - learn to write persuasively and 112.5 - interpret texts and computer science 114.299 - Majors learn to code and use software to 116.1 - solve problems ultimately a major is an 118.68 - investment of our time and that 120.6 - investment pays off and we level up our 122.399 - abilities by completing different 124.02 - segments that our college is set to 125.52 - guide our major Journey the biggest 127.079 - segment will be the series of courses a 129.06 - department or School lays out for a 130.679 - major so that every student meets more 132.72 - or less the same standards so students 134.58 - of the same major may take some of the 136.02 - same courses like an introductory course 138.06 - or a course on a special method used in 139.86 - their field business majors may be 141.599 - required to take accounting chemistry 143.58 - Majors may be required to take lab 144.959 - courses or philosophy Majors may be 146.819 - required to take ethics but there is 148.62 - still some Choice involved because many 150.78 - times there are several different paths 152.94 - through a major to reach the ultimate 154.56 - power-up graduating with your degree so 156.84 - some major courses may have 158.34 - prerequisites which is a course you must 160.44 - take before you're allowed to take a 161.819 - more advanced course it's just like how 163.62 - we usually have to take Algebra 1 before 165.36 - we take algebra 2. other major courses 167.459 - are electives which means students are 169.68 - free to choose from a list When 170.879 - selecting courses electives can help 172.8 - students dive deeper into a topic or 174.66 - hone a particular skill or just explore 176.76 - a new area for example our director Nick 179.34 - was a graph design major but took film 181.62 - courses to round out his education 183.06 - electives can also be helpful if a major 185.459 - has the opportunity to choose a 187.019 - concentration or an even more 188.879 - specialized area of study within a field 190.56 - one of our editors Shep majored in 192.659 - English but concentrated on creative 194.34 - writing Majors might also have the 196.14 - option of completing a thesis or 197.7 - Capstone project writing a thesis or 199.739 - completing a Capstone is kind of like a 202.2 - boss battle it's a challenging research 203.879 - project that serves as a culmination of 205.739 - the degree usually completed during your 207.84 - final year so even if they have the same 210.36 - major not every student will take 212.4 - exactly the same path it's best for 214.319 - students to talk through their plan for 215.64 - completing the Major's requirements with 217.08 - an academic advisor because advisors can 219.48 - explain when certain courses are offered 221.22 - and propose a game plan though you can 223.379 - usually also do your own research by 225.12 - reading about required courses for each 226.68 - major on the department's website some 228.78 - even have a major map to help college 231.0 - students see what courses they need to 232.5 - take and when at this point the password 234.48 - introductory classes to more advanced 236.34 - levels probably already sounds like a 238.5 - lot fortunately there are ways to plan 240.9 - and manage your time and course load to 242.879 - try and avoid being overwhelmed or burnt 244.56 - out as college students we generally get 246.599 - to decide what exactly our schedules 248.159 - look like for that reason it's best to 250.319 - strike a balance as we navigate major 252.659 - requirements and other obligations it's 254.7 - important to make sure the schedule you 256.199 - choose is feasible one way to do that is 258.54 - to balance your course load because 260.34 - major courses are usually not the only 262.32 - required courses in college most schools 264.479 - will also have general education or gen 266.46 - Ed requirements which are introductory 268.56 - level courses in a range of required 270.479 - subjects gen EDS tend to cover core 272.52 - academic areas like composition social 274.74 - science or math sometimes gen Ed classes 277.56 - can broaden our Horizons or help us 279.3 - discover potential majors in the best 281.52 - case scenario gen Ed classes will feel 283.62 - like a useful and interesting Adventure 285.18 - rather than unskippable cut scene some 287.28 - students may find that one gen ed class 289.259 - is more difficult than another so choose 291.3 - classes wisely if you're already taking 293.639 - some challenging courses for your major 295.199 - maybe pick a gen Ed that you'll find 296.759 - easier think about it like prioritizing 298.919 - your quests ultimate Italy major courses 301.38 - in gen EDS are helping us chip away at 303.36 - the total number of credit hours we need 305.039 - to graduate credit hours are like the 306.96 - experience points of college courses 308.46 - each course is worth a certain number 310.199 - and they indicate how many hours per 312.479 - week students will spend in that class 314.16 - so a three credit hour course means that 316.62 - the class meets roughly three hours each 318.479 - week credit hours can also give us a 320.34 - sense of how much time we can expect to 321.9 - spend working outside of Class A good 324.36 - rule of thumb is that for every hour you 326.34 - spend in class you'll spend one to two 328.68 - hours outside of class doing homework 330.6 - setting for exams or writing papers so 333.479 - if a student is enrolled in 15 credit 335.58 - hours they can expect to spend 15 hours 337.8 - a week in class in 15 to 30 hours per 340.44 - week on classwork which is why being a 342.419 - full-time student is like having a 343.74 - full-time job even though you're not in 345.3 - class 40 hours a week of course 346.919 - different classes require different 348.18 - amounts of work but credit hours can be 350.28 - a useful gauge for managing your time 351.84 - each semester and if you plan to work 353.46 - part-time while in college you can use 355.38 - this method to figure out how much time 356.88 - you can expect to spend on classes so 358.68 - you can set a realistic work schedule so 361.08 - really all that's left is to actually 362.94 - choose your classes in major 364.74 - it's a big decision but not one that has 367.199 - to be overly stressful even before 368.88 - starting College you'll probably hear 370.74 - the question what are you studying all 372.479 - the time and it's totally okay to say 374.639 - I'm not sure yet a lot of people start 376.56 - college without knowing what they want 377.94 - to major in and there's nothing wrong 379.62 - with taking some time to weigh our 380.94 - options in fact some departments already 383.34 - have suggested classes for first-year 385.259 - students some engineering programs for 387.419 - example may want new students to take 389.34 - calculus so they know what to expect 391.08 - later on and some students select a 393.36 - desired major on their application but 395.46 - it's normal to remain Undeclared for our 397.5 - first one or two semesters of full-time 399.3 - enrollment in academics speak being 401.52 - undecided means you haven't yet declared 403.44 - a major which is when you yell your 404.819 - favorite subject as loud as you can from 406.199 - your window just kidding declaring a 408.6 - major actually usually just means 410.34 - formally telling the college what path 411.9 - you plan on taking by submitting some 413.52 - paperwork but even if you do shout it 415.56 - from the rooftops don't worry your major 417.72 - isn't necessarily set in stone many 419.94 - students switch Majors when they change 421.199 - their career plans or simply change 422.52 - their mind in fact about a third of 424.8 - students end up switching Majors so 426.599 - pivoting is Not Unusual in college but 429.0 - you should still think about the options 430.56 - because it's not always possible to 432.0 - switch just like that at four-year 433.8 - colleges switching your path late in the 435.66 - game might mean having to stay for extra 437.4 - semesters an extra semesters means extra 440.099 - dollars and trade schools often 442.08 - specialize in degree programs or 443.46 - certificates for a set of careers so if 445.5 - you start at wanting to be a chef and 446.819 - enroll in culinary school but then you 448.56 - decide your passion was really heating 449.88 - ventilation and air conditioning systems 451.56 - that's going to be tricky but not 453.66 - impossible with planning community 455.099 - colleges can also provide several 456.9 - different routes one option is to enroll 459.18 - as a degree seeking student and earn an 461.34 - associate's degree in an area of study 463.199 - but we could also enroll to take college 465.36 - level courses without committing to a 467.22 - degree in either case it's possible for 469.62 - students to transfer from Community 470.879 - College to a four-year institution and 473.099 - save the progress they've made so far 474.479 - when a student transfers or switches 476.28 - schools they can often use the credits 478.199 - they earn at their previous school to 479.58 - satisfy requirements at their next one 481.08 - these are called transfer credits for 483.18 - students undecided on a career path the 485.34 - transfer track at a community college 486.72 - can be a great option as it gets lots of 488.879 - required classes out of the way plus you 491.34 - can get acquainted with the experience 492.479 - of taking college level classes before 493.979 - you declare a major however the sooner 496.379 - you know where you'd like to transfer 497.819 - the sooner you know which courses will 499.68 - transfer for credit generally public 501.9 - schools are more accepting if credits 503.4 - earned elsewhere than private schools 504.84 - but no matter where you go choosing a 507.18 - major can require lots of reflection and 508.979 - planning sometimes our career plan 511.08 - points Us in the right direction like if 513.24 - you want to become a software engineer 514.44 - the computer science major is likely 516.36 - pretty high in your list but some of us 518.159 - are not yet sure what career we want to 520.019 - pursue and some careers don't require us 522.3 - to choose one specific major at all many 524.399 - first-year students are surprised to 525.839 - learn that pre-med in and pre-law aren't 527.94 - themselves Majors but programs to make 530.64 - sure you take all the required classes 532.26 - for Med or law school that can be done 534.0 - with virtually any major so it's worth 536.58 - thinking through your choices a major 538.26 - may be the main storyline of our college 540.12 - career but it doesn't have to be a 541.98 - single player game there are many 544.019 - resources available to help us decide 545.76 - what story will be ours and how to 547.44 - navigate its twists and turns let's go 549.42 - to the thought bubble say Jordan is 551.519 - trying to decide whether to major in 553.019 - English literature or economics when 555.24 - deciding on a major one of the best 556.92 - options is to get advice from people we 558.66 - admire whose careers we find exciting we 560.94 - can also rely on admissions counselors 562.86 -

you have been told by many others if you 2.58 - want to crack the coding interview you 4.319 - have to leak code delete the code.com 6.48 - very popular website for lead code 8.58 - fleetco.com 11.82 - so you the person who has never heard 13.98 - about Lee code sign up and sort the 16.68 - problems from least difficulty 18.84 - start the first problem ready to solve 21.18 - it fast since it's labeled as easy 24.72 - reality starts to hit 26.76 - you read the problem three times and 28.92 - still 29.76 - the constraints look like Greek to you 31.8 - and what is this 34.62 - it seems so simple yet you sit there 37.32 - without any idea of how to implement the 39.54 - solution 45.899 - in this video we're going to go over how 47.82 - to start leak coding as a beginner and 50.1 - how to actually understand and learn 51.84 - while studying for coding interviews my 54.36 - name is Bradley Allen and on this 55.86 - channel we go over important computer 57.3 - science topics with the purpose of 59.34 - making you more knowledgeable let's get 61.86 - into the video 65.339 - it's about every leak code problem has a 67.74 - data structure and algorithm that you 69.96 - have to use to implement to be able to 72.119 - solve it and you must know data 74.58 - structures and algorithms think of data 76.92 - structures and algorithms as a tool to 79.2 - get the job done if you never knew a 81.6 - hammer existed to hit a nail you may end 84.299 - up hitting it with a rock and wondering 86.7 - right why the rock broke this is the 89.28 - same when it comes to leak coding just 91.08 - knowing that a hash map exists is a big 94.619 - hurdle to jump let alone using a hash 97.439 - Map to solve the problem data structures 99.96 - and algorithms is a must-know topic and 102.299 - without it you will never be able to 104.22 - solve problems easily sure you might 106.2 - come up with a solution but without 108.78 - fully understanding or at least knowing 112.2 - about the data structures and algorithms 114.54 - it will be difficult some of you will 116.88 - just ignore me and start lead coding but 119.579 - let me say it again you must know data 121.86 - structures and algorithms to level up 124.32 - and understand these problems with full 127.439 - efficiency 130.8 - so when you choose to solve a problem on 133.2 - lead code there are some things you need 134.76 - to know as a beginner when you pull up 136.739 - leak code you will have a title of the 138.84 - problem which gives hints on how to 140.58 - solve a description which you re you 143.58 - need to really read to understand the 145.739 - problem 146.76 - examples of input and outputs 149.459 - constraints which usually give you the 152.04 - complexity or hint about the complexity 154.26 - you have the language selector and IDE 157.2 - this is where implementation happens in 159.959 - the IDE section you have to finish that 162.54 - function which is usually run in the 164.22 - background to test your code so after 166.319 - you complete the function leak code will 168.72 - it will call the function in the 169.86 - background 170.94 - and test your code against multiple 172.739 - cases and at the bottom here you have 174.66 - run 175.62 - and submit the run is used to run and 179.34 - test your code and make sure it actually 180.54 - works and the submit is to submit when 183.0 - you are done with your solution 186.379 - so you may be wondering how do I 188.819 - actually start lead coding there are 190.98 - four major steps to solve Elite code 193.56 - problem the first is to read and 196.68 - understand the problem this means read 198.72 - and understand the problem if any ideas 200.34 - pop into your head while you are reading 202.62 - do not start coding keep these ideas in 205.62 - the back of your mind read through every 207.48 - single inch of the description and 209.58 - problem and make sure you go over the 211.379 - entire thing do not touch your keyboard 213.599 - until you understand everything about 215.819 - the problem this will prevent skipping 217.8 - over important topics of a problem 219.36 - because if you skip over an important 221.28 - part you may be on the wrong path of 223.44 - solving the second step is to think of 225.959 - all possible solutions in your head or 229.019 - on paper think of a solution use pen and 231.9 - paper like this to map out and try to 235.26 - solve the problem think of edge cases 237.0 - such as input of zero or what would 239.22 - happen when null comes around this is 241.26 - where the actual solving happens in your 243.18 - brand and on paper recall previous 244.799 - questions that you have done and and you 246.72 - can use those ideas from those previous 248.459 - questions to solve the current question 251.4 - the third step is to take your idea that 254.159 - you've came up with with your pencil and 256.019 - paper or in your head and start to 258.18 - implement you should know exactly what 259.979 - to code if your idea was created fully 262.62 - this is the hardest for beginners 264.419 - because you have to be very familiar 266.4 - with your programming language and the 268.86 - fourth and final step know the time and 271.02 - space complexity of your solution this 273.72 - means after implementing Your solution 275.82 - make it a habit of typing the time and 278.639 - space complexity in the comments before 280.74 - or after your function this will let you 283.259 - understand when you come back and study 285.3 - again or you will actually understand 286.68 - why it is O of n or why it is O of n 289.8 - spacer time complexity during the 291.66 - interview you want to give the 293.4 - complexity and not ask for it so by you 295.8 - practicing your Elite coding always 297.479 - looking at the spaces and time 299.16 - complexity you will be ready for the 300.9 - actual interview after you've done these 302.4 - five steps rinse and repeat for 304.199 - different problems you will improve if 305.88 - you stay a consistent and actually think 308.04 - about what you're doing rather than copy 310.02 - and pasting the solution and hitting 311.88 - submit so let me ask you a question what 314.16 - is the point of leak coding I hope you 316.8 - said to prepare for an interview and 318.6 - level up your problem solving and coding 320.639 - skills the point of leak code is not to 322.74 - copy and paste Solutions and hit submit 325.199 - the whole point of leak coding is to 327.6 - level up your knowledge and data 329.039 - structures and algorithms and be 330.479 - prepared for a coding interview Your 332.46 - solution to the elite code problem will 335.16 - be different than others so before you 337.259 - go on the discussion page and look for 339.78 - the solution come up with the solution 341.699 - for your own self because you won't have 343.62 - a discussion page when you're in an 345.479 - interview understanding the problem and 347.46 - creating a solution on your own is the 349.44 - only thing that matters when you're 350.94 - Elite coding because remember that you 352.919 - are doing this for you and not nobody 354.96 - else alright so now I'm going to solve a 356.88 - liquid problem as an example so you guys 359.16 - can understand the process and method of 361.44 - how to actually learn and do this lead 363.96 - code and start leveling up your coding 366.06 - shows guys we are here on my desktop and 369.66 - as you can see we have 206 reverse Elite 371.82 - list this is the title of the question 373.8 - and it's easy but remember easy is just 378.06 - something that they like to post on here 380.28 - it might be hard for you but don't think 381.9 - because it's easy and you can't solve it 384.18 - fast that you're not smart so the 386.28 - description is given the given the head 387.96 - of a singly linked list reverse the list 389.58 - and return the reverse list and it gives 392.16 - you examples here 393.6 - you have one two three four five and 395.58 - five four three two one that's all we 396.9 - have to do reverse the list and then you 398.4 - come down here and you see constraints 400.62 - the number of nodes in the list 402.84 - is in the range of zero to five thousand 405.18 - so in between those those two ranges are 408.6 - going to be the values of the node 410.94 - and you have to sit here and look at the 412.8 - constraints and actually understand 414.0 - because it gives you hints what is the 415.8 - size of the data that we're working with 417.96 - so first thing I would do 421.02 - is get your pen and paper 423.72 - like I have here actually write out the 425.759 - problem so this is what I've wrote out 428.58 - see as you can see here we're going to 430.199 - get rid of the next and make it Point 431.94 - backwards and we're going to keep doing 433.259 - this until null that's the idea I came 435.72 - up with in my head and now we're going 437.58 - to implement it first we're going to 439.74 - have three pointers per previous and 443.4 - next 444.84 - and we're gonna make the curve current 447.0 - pointer equal to head so we're going to 449.039 - have three pointers one two and three 450.36 - and we're gonna keep going keep moving 452.34 - forward keep moving forward and reverse 454.5 - and reverse until current is equal to 456.539 - null and you have to have the 458.46 - visualization in your head of a linked 460.5 - list this is why knowing data structures 462.18 - and algorithms is crucial 463.979 - for when you're solving leak cook 465.24 - problems 467.16 - we completed the problem 469.5 - now the main thing that you need to take 471.36 - away from this is the idea of how you 473.88 - came up with the pro with the solution 475.319 - in your head 476.699 - in the how you went about implementing 479.52 - it because in the interview all you're 482.099 - looking for is to how to think about the 484.44 - answer of the problem you're not really 486.419 - looking at the fastest and quickest way 488.28 - to solve the problem you're looking at 489.84 - how you do it so thank you for watching 491.819 -

Throw some metal in a box\u00a0 and boom [monke]. What the heck is going on here?\u00a0 11.2 - Inside your PC is a Central Processing Unit,\u00a0 or CPU. It\u2019s basically just a piece of silicon\u00a0\u00a0 15.44 - with billions of microscopic switches called\u00a0 transistors. Depending on the flow of electricity,\u00a0\u00a0 19.44 - they can be on or off, kind of like a light\u00a0 bulb, which gives us two states: 1 and 0.\u00a0 23.76 - The value at one of these switches is called a\u00a0 \u201cbit\u201d. One bit by itself doesn\u2019t really do much.\u00a0\u00a0 28.64 - But put them together, and magic starts to happen. A group of 8 bits is called a \u201cbyte\u201d and can\u00a0\u00a0 32.72 - have 256 different combinations of 0s and 1s.\u00a0 Congratulations! We can now store information\u00a0\u00a0 37.6 - by counting in a system called \u201cbinary\u201d. Every bit represents a power of 2,\u00a0\u00a0 41.08 - 1 meaning the power is included and 0 meaning\u00a0 it\u2019s not, so this number has 1 times 64,\u00a0\u00a0 45.0 - 1 times 4, and 1 times 1, which adds up to 69. This is nice, but for humans, hexadecimal is\u00a0\u00a0 50.2 - even better: It\u2019s often denoted by this 0x and\u00a0 is simply a more readable format than binary:\u00a0\u00a0 54.84 - Four binary bits can take any value from\u00a0 0 to 15. Hexadecimal uses 0-9 and a-f\u00a0\u00a0 60.08 - to represent those values, so a group of four\u00a0 bits can be replaced by one hexadecimal digit.\u00a0 64.88 - Okay. Now that we can store numbers,\u00a0 we just need computers to actually,\u00a0\u00a0 67.72 - you know, do something with them. Using transistors, you can make logic gates,\u00a0\u00a0 71.24 - which are electronic circuits that encapsulate\u00a0 logical statements. You can think of it as a\u00a0\u00a0 74.92 - lightbulb with two switches, where the light\u00a0 only turns on under certain conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 78.28 - For example, only if A AND B are on. By combining logic gates in a clever way,\u00a0\u00a0 82.6 - you can build circuits that perform calculations\u00a0 according to Boolean algebra, which is a system\u00a0\u00a0 86.44 - formalizing mathematical operations in binary. But, even though computers understand 0s and 1s,\u00a0\u00a0 91.4 - for humans, it\u2019s not really all that useful.\u00a0 So, using a character encoding like ASCII,\u00a0\u00a0 95.92 - we can assign a binary number to each\u00a0 character. When you type an A on your keyboard,\u00a0\u00a0 99.32 - it gets translated into this binary code, and as\u00a0 soon as the computer sees this, it says: \u201cAh yes,\u00a0\u00a0 104.52 - that is a capital A.\u201d, and slaps it on the screen. How these devices fit together is handled by an\u00a0\u00a0 108.8 - operating system kernel, like Windows, Linux or\u00a0 Mac, which sits between computer hardware and\u00a0\u00a0 112.68 - applications and manages how they all work\u00a0 together, for example with device drivers.\u00a0 116.64 - Input devices allow you to give the computer\u00a0 instructions with the press of a button,\u00a0\u00a0 120.0 - but at the lowest level, computers only\u00a0 understand instructions in machine code,\u00a0\u00a0 123.2 - which is binary code telling the CPU\u00a0 what to do, and which data to use.\u00a0 126.76 - When it comes to following these instructions,\u00a0 the CPU is kind of like a genius, just with the\u00a0\u00a0 130.88 - memory of a demented goldfish. It can handle\u00a0 any instructions but it cannot store any data,\u00a0\u00a0 135.08 - so it\u2019s only really useful with\u00a0 random access memory or RAM.\u00a0 138.12 - You can imagine it like a grid, where\u00a0 every box can hold one byte of information,\u00a0\u00a0 141.56 - which can be data or instructions, and has an\u00a0 address, so the CPU can access it in four steps:\u00a0 146.28 - Fetch from memory, decode instructions\u00a0 and data and finally, execute and store\u00a0\u00a0 150.12 - the result. This is one machine cycle. Since a program is basically just a list\u00a0\u00a0 153.88 - of instructions in memory, to run it,\u00a0 the CPU executes them one by one in\u00a0\u00a0 157.2 - machine cycles until it\u2019s complete. Oh yeah did\u00a0 I mention that this happens, like, really fast?\u00a0 161.68 - Modern CPUs can do billions of cycles every\u00a0 second, which are coordinated and synchronized\u00a0\u00a0 165.88 - by a clock generator. The speed of this clock\u00a0 is measured in GHz, and people often overclock\u00a0\u00a0 170.12 - their CPUs to improve performance, which is\u00a0 nice, but might just set your PC on fire.\u00a0 174.4 - What\u2019s ever crazier though, is that a CPU has\u00a0 multiple cores, which can all execute different\u00a0\u00a0 178.68 - instructions in parallel, so at the same time.\u00a0 Each core can be split into multiple threads,\u00a0\u00a0 183.48 - which also allows every single core to\u00a0 handle multiple instructions concurrently,\u00a0\u00a0 186.8 - so switch between them really quickly. Okay, that\u2019s cool, but it doesn\u2019t matter\u00a0\u00a0 190.76 - how powerful a computer is if you have no way\u00a0 to give it instructions in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0 194.56 - Typing machine code by hand would probably make\u00a0 you go insane, but luckily, you don\u2019t have to:\u00a0 198.72 - The kernel is wrapped in a shell, which is just\u00a0 a program that exposes the kernel to the user,\u00a0\u00a0 202.56 - allowing for simple instructions in a\u00a0 command line interface with text inputs.\u00a0 206.04 - But the best way to make a computer do\u00a0 something useful is with a programming language,\u00a0\u00a0 209.24 - which uses abstraction, so that instead of\u00a0 this, you can write code that looks like this,\u00a0\u00a0 213.12 - which is then converted into machine code for you. Some languages like Python use an interpreter,\u00a0\u00a0 217.56 - which directly tries to execute the source\u00a0 code line by line. Other languages like C\u00a0\u00a0 221.32 - or GO use a compiler, which converts\u00a0 the entire program into machine code,\u00a0\u00a0 224.72 - before putting it in a file the CPU can execute. Now, every programming language has different\u00a0\u00a0 228.96 - syntax, but there\u2019s some basic\u00a0 tools almost all of them have:\u00a0 231.68 - The most basic way to use data is with\u00a0 variables, which assigns a value to a name,\u00a0\u00a0 235.16 - which can then be reused and modified. Depending on the value, variables can have\u00a0\u00a0 238.8 - different data types. For text, there\u2019s single\u00a0 characters and strings of multiple characters.\u00a0 242.84 - For numbers, there\u2019s integers, which can also\u00a0 be signed if they\u2019re negative, and floating\u00a0\u00a0 246.08 - point numbers for decimal values. They\u2019re called\u00a0 floating point, because the decimal point can\u00a0\u00a0 249.68 - float around to trade off precision with range.\u00a0 This is possible because they use scientific\u00a0\u00a0 253.96 - notation. It\u2019s some number times a power telling\u00a0 you where to put the decimal point, which is\u00a0\u00a0 257.76 - exactly what they look like under the hood. The actual number is stored with binary\u00a0\u00a0 261.24 - fractions. Some fractions like 1/3 can only be\u00a0 approximated in binary with an infinite sum, but,\u00a0\u00a0 266.24 - since memory is not infinite, you have to cut it\u00a0 off at some point, which leads to rounding errors,\u00a0\u00a0 270.0 - causing pretty weird calculations, sometimes. If these are not enough, long and double\u00a0\u00a0 273.84 - use twice the amount of memory to\u00a0 double the range of ints and floats.\u00a0 276.96 - Some languages like Python automatically\u00a0 figure out which type a variable is,\u00a0\u00a0 280.44 - but in a language like C, you have to\u00a0 explicitly declare the type of a variable.\u00a0 284.16 - The value of a variable is stored at some\u00a0 address in memory. Pointers are variables whose\u00a0\u00a0 287.92 - value is the memory address of another variable,\u00a0 which is denoted by this ampersand. So really,\u00a0\u00a0 292.16 - a pointer is just some chunk of memory,\u00a0 pointing to another chunk of memory.\u00a0 295.56 - Since a memory address is just a number,\u00a0 you can add and subtract from it to navigate\u00a0\u00a0 298.92 - through individual bytes of memory.\u00a0 This is called \u201cpointer arithmetic\u201d.\u00a0 301.96 - In some low-level languages like C, you have to\u00a0 manually allocate and free up memory once it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 305.76 - no longer used. This all happens in the heap,\u00a0 which is a part of memory that can dynamically\u00a0\u00a0 309.36 - grow and shrink as the program demands,\u00a0 which allows for more control but makes in\u00a0\u00a0 312.56 - incredibly easy to completely break your code. You could touch memory you\u2019re not supposed to,\u00a0\u00a0 316.44 - or that simply doesn\u2019t exist, which is known as\u00a0 a \u201csegmentation fault\u201d. But also, if there\u2019s some\u00a0\u00a0 320.16 - chunk of memory that\u2019s no longer used, and you\u00a0 forget to free it or you have no way to access\u00a0\u00a0 323.96 - it anymore, that memory is no longer usable. This is called a \u201cmemory leak\u201d and will make\u00a0\u00a0 327.8 - the program slow down and eventually crash. To avoid this mess, high level languages\u00a0\u00a0 331.56 - like Python have built in garbage\u00a0 collectors that manage memory for you.\u00a0 334.96 - Different data types take up a different amount of\u00a0 memory. Integers are most often 4 bytes of memory.\u00a0 339.16 - A single character is most often one\u00a0 byte of memory, and a string is just\u00a0\u00a0 342.08 - multiple character bytes, with a \u201cNUL\u201d\u00a0 character to signal the end of the string.\u00a0 345.2 - Storing multiple items in a contiguous chunk\u00a0 of memory like this is the idea of an array:\u00a0 349.2 - More generally, it\u2019s a list of\u00a0 items with the same data type,\u00a0\u00a0 351.8 - with each item having a numerical index, most\u00a0 often starting at 0. Since the items are next\u00a0\u00a0 356.24 - to each other in memory, by knowing the address\u00a0 of the first item, you can quickly index to any\u00a0\u00a0 360.36 - item in the array by using pointer arithmetic. Arrays are what\u2019s known as a data structure,\u00a0\u00a0 364.56 - which is just a way to organize\u00a0 data to make it easier to work with.\u00a0 367.64 - Retrieving values from an array is blazingly\u00a0 fast, but the size of an array is often fixed\u00a0\u00a0 371.8 - when creating it, so when it\u2019s full, you can\u2019t\u00a0 add anything, and if you don\u2019t use all of it,\u00a0\u00a0 375.24 - it\u2019s just wasted memory, so a more\u00a0 flexible option is a linked list.\u00a0 378.6 - It uses nodes containing a value\u00a0 and a pointer to the next node,\u00a0\u00a0 381.44 - which allows them to be spread apart in memory.\u00a0 Also, it can grow and shrink dynamically,\u00a0\u00a0 384.76 - as you can add and remove any node, and you can\u00a0 reorder it, by simply rearranging the pointers.\u00a0 389.16 - This is great, but they can be impractical, as\u00a0 you have no way to access the last node except\u00a0\u00a0 392.96 - if you traverse every single one before it. But\u00a0 still, both arrays and liked lists are useful,\u00a0\u00a0 397.32 - as they allow you to create queues and stacks. A stack follows the last in, first out principle,\u00a0\u00a0 401.76 - just like taking a pancake from a stack.\u00a0 Practically, just imagine a pointer that\u00a0\u00a0 405.32 - always points to the item that was last added\u00a0 to the structure. Then you can pop, so remove\u00a0\u00a0 409.32 - the last item which increments the pointer back. A queue follows the first in first out principle\u00a0\u00a0 413.72 - and uses two pointers, one for\u00a0 the first item that was added,\u00a0\u00a0 416.2 - and one for the last. Any new item gets added\u00a0 after the last pointer, which is then updated,\u00a0\u00a0 420.36 - and dequeuing starts at the first pointer. Another useful data structure is a hash map,\u00a0\u00a0 424.52 - which is just a collection of key value pairs. It works kind of like an array but uses a hash\u00a0\u00a0 428.56 - function to take a key and assign it to\u00a0 an index, where its value is then stored.\u00a0 432.2 - But sometimes, two different keys can map to the\u00a0 same index, which is called a \u201ccollision\u201d. There\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 436.28 - different ways to deal with this, but one way is\u00a0 to create a linked list at that position in the\u00a0\u00a0 439.76 - array, which makes it a little slower to look up\u00a0 that value, but still, hash maps are incredibly\u00a0\u00a0 444.2 - useful, because you can define the keys that point\u00a0 to every value, and since they\u2019re based on arrays,\u00a0\u00a0 448.12 - retrieving them is blazingly fast. For many problems, it can be very\u00a0\u00a0 451.6 - useful to represent the relationship between\u00a0 different datapoints as a data structure.\u00a0 455.4 - If you take the nodes of a linked list, but\u00a0 allow any node to point to any other node,\u00a0\u00a0 458.84 - you get a graph, where the nodes are\u00a0 connected by edges that can be directed,\u00a0\u00a0 462.24 - undirected and can even carry a weight, which can\u00a0 stand for any metric, such as distance or cost.\u00a0 466.88 - Graphs are useful for analyzing groups inside\u00a0 networks or finding the shortest path between two\u00a0\u00a0 470.76 - points, for example in Google Maps. There\u2019s two\u00a0 main ways to search a graph: Breadth first search,\u00a0\u00a0 475.04 - starts at one node and moves out layer by\u00a0 layer until it finds the target node for the\u00a0\u00a0 478.4 - first time. Depth first search explores every\u00a0 single path fully until it reaches a dead end,\u00a0\u00a0 482.72 - then it backtracks to the last node with a\u00a0 different path and continues from there in\u00a0\u00a0 485.92 - the same way until it finds the target node. A graph where any two nodes are connected by\u00a0\u00a0 490.16 - exactly one path is called a tree, and represents\u00a0 a hierarchy, for example the file system on your\u00a0\u00a0 494.36 - computer. A tree starts at the root and branches\u00a0 out into subtrees, which end in leaf nodes.\u00a0 498.88 - Parent nodes can have any number of child\u00a0 nodes, but oftentimes, binary trees are the\u00a0\u00a0 502.52 - most useful. For example, a binary tree where\u00a0 all the values left of any node are smaller,\u00a0\u00a0 506.44 - and all the values right of it are greater,\u00a0 is called a \u201cbinary search tree\u201d, which makes\u00a0\u00a0 509.64 - finding specific values super fast. If you want to find a target value, just\u00a0\u00a0 513.24 - start at the root. If the target is smaller than\u00a0 that node , go left, if it\u2019s greater, go right,\u00a0\u00a0 517.28 - and repeat this until you find the target. What we just used is a very simple algorithm,\u00a0\u00a0 521.48 - which is just a set of instructions\u00a0 that solves a problem step by step.\u00a0 524.68 - The simplest way to write an algorithm is\u00a0 in the form of a function. It takes inputs,\u00a0\u00a0 528.16 - does something with them, and returns an output. Just like variables, you can then call a function\u00a0\u00a0 532.12 - by its name and pass in different arguments. When calling a function, the function call\u00a0\u00a0 535.72 - gets pushed onto the call stack, which is\u00a0 short-term memory used for executing code,\u00a0\u00a0 539.24 - and as the name implies, it\u2019s based on the stack\u00a0 data structure, which means last in first out.\u00a0 543.52 - To implement algorithms, you often have to\u00a0 compare two values, which you can do with\u00a0\u00a0 546.88 - operators like greater than or equality, and\u00a0 logical expressions such as AND, OR and NOT.\u00a0 551.8 - Expressions like these are simple:\u00a0 they can be true or false, which are\u00a0\u00a0 554.76 - the possible values of the Boolean data type\u00a0 and allow you to write conditional statements:\u00a0 558.92 - If some condition is true, do this, else do that. Booleans can also be used to loop over certain\u00a0\u00a0 564.32 - parts of code. One way is with a while loop: While\u00a0 this condition is true, this code will execute.\u00a0 568.92 - Another way is a for loop, which can iterate\u00a0 over every element inside a data structure\u00a0\u00a0 572.44 - like an array, but can also loop for a specific\u00a0 number of iterations, by setting a starting value,\u00a0\u00a0 576.68 - incrementing it after each iteration, and\u00a0 setting an upper bound with a condition.\u00a0 580.24 - Functions can also call themselves, which is known\u00a0 as \u201crecursion\u201d. This is useful when a problem\u00a0\u00a0 584.2 - can be broken down into smaller identical\u00a0 problems, such as calculating 5 factorial,\u00a0\u00a0 588.08 - which is just 5 times 4 factorial, which\u00a0 is just 4 times 3 factorial and so on.\u00a0 591.84 - But, by default, a recursive function will\u00a0 just keep on calling itself forever. This\u00a0\u00a0 595.52 - means that it keeps pushing more function\u00a0 calls onto the call stack, until the stack\u00a0\u00a0 598.72 - memory is exceeded in a \u201cstack overflow\u201d. To stop this, you have to add a base condition\u00a0\u00a0 603.68 - to a recursive function, which defines when\u00a0 to stop. Only then will the function calls\u00a0\u00a0 607.24 - be executed without crashing your PC. Recursion is cool, but it can be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 611.28 - expensive time and spacewise. So, to minimize the\u00a0 amount of computations needed, past results can be\u00a0\u00a0 615.96 - saved in a cache, so if they come up again,\u00a0 the computer doesn\u2019t have to recompute them\u00a0\u00a0 619.48 - from scratch. This is called \u201cmemoization\u201d. Speaking of performance, to judge how good\u00a0\u00a0 623.36 - an algorithm is, you can look at time and\u00a0 space complexity, so how much time or space\u00a0\u00a0 627.0 - is required to run it. This is measured in Big\u00a0 O notation, which describes the relationship\u00a0\u00a0 630.88 - between growth of input size and number of\u00a0 operations needed to execute the algorithm.\u00a0 634.84 - For example, adding 1 to every number inside an\u00a0 array is O(n), because the number of operations\u00a0\u00a0 639.32 - increases in a linear way as the array grows. What\u2019s relevant is not the exact number of\u00a0\u00a0 643.6 - operations, but rather the trend as the the input\u00a0 size goes to infinity. You see, something like n!\u00a0\u00a0 648.48 - grows way faster than any linear function ever\u00a0 could, so as long as the time complexity is some\u00a0\u00a0 653.28 - kind of linear relation, it\u2019s simplified down to\u00a0 O(n), and the same thing goes for any other group.\u00a0 657.92 - When writing algorithms, there\u2019s some general\u00a0 approaches: For example, when searching an item\u00a0\u00a0 660.189 - in a list, a brute force approach would be to\u00a0 simply check every item until we find the target,\u00a0\u00a0 664.08 - but a more sophisticated approach would be divide\u00a0 and conquer. For example, in binary search,\u00a0\u00a0 670.52 - you cut the problem in half each time by checking\u00a0 the middle element of a list and seeing on which\u00a0\u00a0 672.64 - side the target is until you land on the target. Now, when solving a problem with code, there\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 677.856 - always multiple ways to achieve the same result,\u00a0 which are called programming paradigms. Let\u2019s try\u00a0\u00a0 680.195 - to find the sum of all elements in this list. \u201cDeclarative programming\u201d, describes what the\u00a0\u00a0 682.04 - code does, but not how exactly the computer\u00a0 should do it, whereas \u201cImperative programming\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 686.0 - explicitly describes how the computer should\u00a0 achieve a result with detailed instructions.\u00a0 690.28 - An extension of imperative programming is\u00a0 object-oriented programming, where you can\u00a0\u00a0 693.64 - define classes as blueprints for objects, which\u00a0 are single units consisting of data in the form of\u00a0\u00a0 698.16 - properties and behaviours in the form of methods. To code a call, you begin by defining the\u00a0\u00a0 702.28 - properties as variables, and\u00a0 the methods as functions.\u00a0 705.4 - After encapsulating properties and methods\u00a0 in a class, you can instantiate an object\u00a0\u00a0 709.16 - and use the dot notation to work\u00a0 with its properties and methods.\u00a0 712.4 - Classes make it easy to organize and reuse code,\u00a0 because you can define subclasses that inherit\u00a0\u00a0 716.64 - properties and behaviours of a superclass,\u00a0 but can also extend and override them.\u00a0 720.64 - For example, a RubberDuck subclass might implement\u00a0 quack() with a squeak(), instead. As a result,\u00a0\u00a0 725.16 - rubber rucks can be treated as objects of the\u00a0 Duck class, but behave differently when quack()\u00a0\u00a0 728.88 - is called, which is the concept of \u201cpolymorphism\u201d. But for some problems, none of these traditional\u00a0\u00a0 733.28 - paradigms will work. Let\u2019s say you want to make\u00a0\u00a0 735.12 - a computer recognize which of these images\u00a0 is a bee. The problem is, you can\u2019t really\u00a0\u00a0 739.4 - describe what a bee looks like with code. This is where machine learning comes in,\u00a0\u00a0 742.88 - aka teaching a computer to do a task without\u00a0 explicitly programming it to do that task.\u00a0 747.68 - First you need a lot of data which\u00a0 you split into training and test data.\u00a0 751.4 - Next you choose an algorithm that\u00a0 can change its parameters over time,\u00a0\u00a0 754.36 - for example a neural network, where the weights\u00a0 can be updated to achieve a different result. By\u00a0\u00a0 758.4 - feeding lots and lots of training data into\u00a0 this algorithm you can build a model, whose\u00a0\u00a0 762.04 - accuracy you can then check with the test data. If it\u2019s not quite right, the model can improve\u00a0\u00a0 766.04 - over time by comparing the output to what it\u00a0 should have been, capturing the difference\u00a0\u00a0 769.48 - in an error function, and tweaking its\u00a0 parameters to minimize the difference.\u00a0 772.96 - But no matter how futuristic, bleeding-edge,\u00a0 blazingly fast and optimized it is, if you\u00a0\u00a0 777.12 - want people to actually use the application\u00a0 you wrote, you should probably know about\u00a0\u00a0 780.04 - the internet. It\u2019s a network of computers from\u00a0 all around the globe connected by wires. Like,\u00a0\u00a0 784.24 - literally, the internet is a bunch of thicc\u00a0 cables that run at the bottom of the ocean\u00a0\u00a0 788.08 - along with facilities like Internet Service\u00a0 Providers that connect you to your destination.\u00a0 792.2 - These computers communicate with the Internet\u00a0 Protocol Suite. Every computer on the network\u00a0\u00a0 796.08 - has a unique IP address. Two computers can\u00a0 then transfer data with the transmission\u00a0\u00a0 799.84 - control protocol. It breaks messages into a bunch\u00a0 of packets, sends them through a network of wires,\u00a0\u00a0 804.2 - before the receiving end puts the message back\u00a0 together. If you have a poor internet connection,\u00a0\u00a0 807.88 - you might have experienced \u201cpacket loss\u201d, which is\u00a0 just if some these packets get lost along the way.\u00a0 811.96 - If the internet is the hardware, then the web is\u00a0 the software, which you can use with a browser.\u00a0 816.08 - Every page on the web has a URL. When you type it\u00a0 into your browser, it looks up the IP address of\u00a0\u00a0 820.4 - the server hosting this website with the domain\u00a0 name system, which is like a dictionary mapping\u00a0\u00a0 824.44 - domain names to IP addresses of actual servers. After connecting to it via TCP, your browser,\u00a0\u00a0 829.28 - called the client, uses the hypertext transfer\u00a0 protocol to send an http request to the server,\u00a0\u00a0 833.8 - which then gives a response, ideally\u00a0 containing the contents of the webpage.\u00a0 837.28 - The actual website most often consists of three\u00a0 parts: An HTML file contains all the content of\u00a0\u00a0 841.68 - a website and is basically just a collection of\u00a0 elements, which can be text, links, buttons and\u00a0\u00a0 845.84 - so on. A CSS file controls the visuals and makes\u00a0 a website look nice. But, a website is useless if\u00a0\u00a0 850.64 - pressing nice looking buttons does nothing, so\u00a0 a language like JavaScript adds functionality.\u00a0 855.2 - But sometimes things can go wrong. With\u00a0 every http response comes a response code,\u00a0\u00a0 859.6 - which carries information about the status\u00a0 of the response. For example, 200 means \u201cOK\u201d,\u00a0\u00a0 863.88 - and anything starting with 4 is an error, the\u00a0 most famous one being \u201c404 \u2013 page not found\u201d.\u00a0 868.52 - HTTP requests can carry different methods, for\u00a0 example GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, so retrieve,\u00a0\u00a0 873.64 - add, update and delete information. These are\u00a0 often used by Application Programming Interfaces,\u00a0\u00a0 878.36 - which connect two applications and allow\u00a0 them to interact with each other, for\u00a0\u00a0 881.68 - example store and retrieve data from a database. The most common type of database is a relational\u00a0\u00a0 886.24 - database, which uses tables to store data. Columns of a table contain different attributes,\u00a0\u00a0 890.6 - and rows represent individual datapoints.\u00a0 Also, each table has one unique attribute\u00a0\u00a0 895.24 - called the primary key. A foreign key\u00a0 is the primary key of another table,\u00a0\u00a0 899.04 - establishing a relationship between the two. In\u00a0 this case, each book is connected to an author.\u00a0 903.44 - With a language like SQL, you can write statements\u00a0 to work with data from these tables. You could\u00a0\u00a0 907.56 - look up the titles and authors of all books,\u00a0 whose title starts with \u201cH\u201d, but for that,\u00a0\u00a0 911.52 - we have to join the authors table with\u00a0 the books table on the matching key to\u00a0\u00a0 915.24 - combine two attributes from different\u00a0 tables into one, giving us this output.\u00a0 919.44 - These statements are useful, but you\u2019ve got\u00a0 to be careful, or you might just delete an\u00a0\u00a0 922.8 - entire database with one line of code. But,\u00a0 don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s never happened before.\u00a0 927.48 - Behind every login page is a database with\u00a0 usernames and passwords. When a user tries to\u00a0\u00a0 931.48 - log in, an SQL query is often used to check if the\u00a0 user input matches with an entry in the database.\u00a0 936.68 - That\u2019s good, but, a devious actor could type\u00a0 something like this, which changes the query by\u00a0\u00a0 941.0 - terminating the string early and commenting out\u00a0 the rest, which means as long as this username\u00a0\u00a0 945.04 - exists in the database, access is granted. This is called an SQL injection attack and\u00a0\u00a0 949.427 - is one of the easiest ways hackers\u00a0 get places they\u2019re not supposed to. 963.72 - Hearing about all these concepts is\u00a0 one thing, but to really learn them,\u00a0\u00a0 966.4 - you have to see them in action and use\u00a0 them yourself, which is exactly what you\u00a0\u00a0 969.24 - can do with Brilliant, which has thousands\u00a0 of interactive lessons for everything from\u00a0\u00a0 972.28 - math and data science to programming and AI.

Another reason you can't blindly trust your intuition is your natural tendency toward 64.37 - overconfidence. 65.37 - Sometimes, you just really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're 70.77 - really, really wrong. 72.32 - We've all been there. 73.32 - We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions. 77.54 - For example, if you flip a coin five times you have equal chances of getting all tails 82.14 - as you do getting alternating heads and tails. 85.22 - But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that 90.03 - result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have. 93.43 - That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation, 98.74 - and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. 101.85 - They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds 106.42 - from the stupidity of our minds. 107.94 - So I hope that it won't be a spoiler if I tell you now that pizza won't make you trip, 113.07 - and coffee doesn't make you smart. 119.11 - Sorry. 121.45 - [Intro] 123.8 - In most ways psychological research is no different than any other scientific discipline, 130.44 - like step one is always figuring out how to ask general questions about your subject and 135.21 - turn them into measurable, testable propositions. 138.2 - This is called operationalizing your questions. 140.96 - So you know how the scientific method works -- it starts with a question and a theory, 144.77 - and I don't mean theory in the sense of like, a hunch that say, a quad-shot of espresso 149.33 - makes you think better. 150.76 - Instead, in science a theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations 156.18 - and predicts outcomes. 157.26 - And when you come up with a testable prediction, that's your hypothesis. 160.94 - Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report 165.32 - them with, so for example, defining exactly what you mean by \"thinking better\" with your 168.99 - espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. 173.15 - And replication is key. 175.47 - You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won't prove very much, but if 179.87 - you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you're 184.21 - probably on to something. 185.4 - This is a problem with one popular type of psychological research: case studies, which 189.81 - take an in-depth look at one individual. 192.52 - Case studies can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, 196.55 - so they run the risk of over-generalizing. 198.16 - Still, they're good at showing us what CAN happen, and end up framing questions for more 202.93 - extensive and generalizable studies. 205.18 - They're also often memorable and a great story telling device psychologists use to observe 209.34 - and describe behavior. 210.48 - Like, say the smell of coffee makes Carl suddenly anxious and irritable -- that obviously doesn't 215.56 - mean that it has that same effect on everyone. 217.45 - In fact, Carl has terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually 222.459 - quite rare. 223.53 - Poor Carl. 224.53 - But you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively. 228.1 - Another popular method of psychological research is naturalistic observation, where researchers 232.65 - simply watch behavior in a natural environment, whether that's chimps poking ant-hills in 237.49 - the jungle, kids clowning in a classroom or drunk dudes yelling at soccer games. 241.349 - The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing without trying to manipulate or control 245.66 - the situation. 246.66 - So yeah, basically just spying on people. 249.01 - Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they're 253.069 - very limited in explaining it. 255.13 - Psychologists can also collect behavioral data using surveys or interviews, asking people 259.18 - to report their opinions and behaviors. 261.72 - Sexuality researcher Alfred Kinsey famously used this technique when he surveyed thousands 265.82 - of men and women on their sexual history and published his findings in a pair of revolutionary 271.04 - texts, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Female respectively. 275.18 - Surveys are a great way to access consciously held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask 279.55 - the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results. 283.57 - For example more forceful words like \"ban\" or \"censor\" may elicit different reactions 287.85 - than \"limit\" or \"not allow\". 290.18 - Asking \"Do you believe in space aliens?\" is a much different question than \"Do you think 293.91 - that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe?\" 296.13 - It's the same question, but in the first the subject might assume you mean aliens visiting 300.37 - earth, and making crop circles and abducting people and poking them. 303.71 - And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask. 306.48 - I could ask a room full of students at a pacifist club meeting what they think about arms control, 310.71 - but the result wouldn't be a representative measure of where students stand, because there's 314.62 - a pretty clear sampling bias at work here. 316.63 - To fairly represent a population, I'd need to get a random sample where all members of 321.09 - the target group, in this case students, had an equal chance of being selected to answer 325.56 - the question. 326.56 - So once you've described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, 330.8 - you can start making sense out of it, and even predict future behavior. 334.59 - One way to do that is to look at one trait or behavior is related to another, or how 339.05 - they correlate. 340.05 - So let's get back to my buddy Bob who seems to think that his refrigerator is actually 343.21 - some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely. 345.85 - Let's say that Bob has just tucked into a lunch of questionable leftovers, pizza that 349.621 - may very well have had a little bit of fungus on it. 352.12 - But he was hungry, and lazy, and so he doused it in Sriracha. 356.0 - Suddenly, he starts seeing things: green armadillos with laser beam eyes. 359.49 - From here we could deduce that eating unknown fungus predicts hallucination, that's a correlation. 364.46 - But correlation is not causation. 366.74 - Yes, it makes sense that eating questionable fungus would cause hallucinations, but it's 371.33 - possible that Bob was already on the verge of a psychotic episode, and those fuzzy leftovers 375.87 - were actually benign. 377.15 - Or there could be an entirely different factor involved, like maybe he hadn't slept in 72 381.639 - hours, or had an intense migraine coming on, and one of those factors caused his hallucinations. 386.26 - It's tempting to draw conclusions from correlations, but it's super-important to remember that 390.229 - correlations predict the possibility of cause-and-effect relationships; they cannot prove them. 395.91 - So we've talked about how to describe behavior without manipulating it and how to make connections 400.4 - and predictions from those findings. 402.22 - But that can only take you so far; to really get to the bottom of cause-and-effect behaviors, 406.54 - you're gonna have to start experimenting. 408.94 - Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent 412.889 - variable, and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. 417.61 - This means that they need at least two groups: the experimental group, which is gonna get 421.44 - messed with, and the control group, which is not gonna get messed with. 425.11 - Just as surveys use random samples, experimental researchers need to randomly assign participants 429.35 - to each group to minimize potential confounding variables, or outside factors that may skew 434.11 - the results. 435.11 - You don't want all grumpy teenagers in one group and all wealthy Japanese surfers in 438.26 - the other; they gotta mingle. 439.38 - Now sometimes one or both groups are not informed about what's actually being tested. 444.35 - For example, researchers can test how substances effect people by comparing their effects to 448.639 - placebos, or inert substances. 450.6 - And often, the researchers themselves don't know which group is experimental and which 454.639 - is control, so they don't unintentionally influence the results through their own behavior, 459.36 - in which case it's called, you guessed it, a double blind procedure. 463.54 - So let's put these ideas into practice in our own little experiment. 466.52 - Like all good work, it starts with a question. 468.82 - So the other day my friend Bernice and I were debating. 470.7 - We were debating caffeine's effect on the brain. 473.3 - Personally, she convinced that coffee helps her focus and think better, but I get all 477.509 - jittery like a caged meerkat and can't focus on anything. 480.36 - And because we know that overconfidence can lead you to believe things that are not true, 483.77 - we decided to use some critical thinking. 485.7 - So let's figure out our question: \"Do humans solve problems faster when given caffeine?\" 490.29 - Now we gotta boil that down into a testable prediction. 492.96 - Remember: keep it clear, simple, and eloquent so that it can be replicated. 497.35 - \"Caffeine makes me smarter\" is not a great hypothesis. 500.13 - A better one would be, say, \"Adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster 505.38 - than humans not given caffeine.\" 507.06 - The caffeine dosage is your independent variable, the thing that you can change. 510.58 - So, you'll need some coffee. 512.379 - Your result or dependent variable, the thing that depends on the thing that you can change 516.559 - is going to be the speed at which the subject navigates through this giant corn maze. 520.079 - Go out on the street, wrangle up a bunch of different kinds of people and randomly assign 523.899 - them into three different groups. 525.67 - Also at this point, the American Psychological Association suggests that you acquire everyone's 529.22 - informed consent to participate. 531.37 - You don't want to force anyone to be in your experiment, no matter how cool you think it 535.189 - is. 536.189 - So the control group gets a placebo, in this case decaf. 538.3 - Experimental group one gets a low dose of caffeine, which we'll define at a 100 milligrams; 542.569 - just an eye opener, like, a cup of coffee's worth. 545.209 - Experimental group two gets 500 milligrams, more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in 549.79 - a Red Bull. 550.79 - Once you dose everyone, turn them lose in the maze and wait at the other end with a 553.99 - stopwatch. 554.99 - All that's left is to measure your results from the three different groups and compare 557.86 - them to see if there were any conclusive results. 560.139 - If the highly dosed folks got through it twice as fast as the low dose and the placebo groups, 564.23 - then Bernice's hypothesis was correct, and she can rub my face in it saying she was right 568.12 - all along, but really that would just be the warm flush of hindsight bias telling her something 573.3 - she didn't really know until we tested it. 575.569 - Then, because we've used clear language and defined our parameters, other curious minds 579.519 - can easily replicate this experiment, and we can eventually pool all the data together 583.629 - and have something solid to say about what that macchiato was doing to your cognition\u2013 588.25 - or at least the speed at which you can run through a maze. 591.16 - Science: probably the best tool that you have for understanding other people. 594.129 -

219.219 - Well, 219.886 - it\u2019s not that simple 221.012 - You see, 221.638 - when most people are thinking about the solution 223.848 - what they are actually thinking about 225.35 -  is how to code the solution 227.143 - and there\u2019s a big difference between the two. 229.145 - To explain what I mean, 230.396 - let\u2019s walk through this easy problem on Leetcode. 232.649 - In this problem, 233.65 - you are given the root node of 2 binary trees 235.985 - and you need to tell whether the 2 binary trees are the same 238.571 - You can pause the video here if you want to solve the problem yourself 241.574 - A beginner might look at the given function and start thinking about checking the value at the root node of both trees 246.871 - to see if it's the same. 248.206 - In the next step, 249.165 -  they would start thinking how they can compare the value of the nodes to the left 252.71 - or the right of the root nodes 254.379 - This way of solving might work for this easy problem 256.881 - but if you are doing this, 258.132 - you are actually thinking about how to code the solution 260.51 - Now, 261.135 - I want you to forget that you know how to code. 263.137 -  Just think about this 264.514 - Given the root nodes of 2 binary trees, 266.808 - What needs to be true for them to be the same. 268.977 - Value of the root node needs to be the same, 271.229 -  the left subtree needs to be the same 273.106 - and the right subtree needs to be the same. Once you see that, 276.025 - the solution is just this one line of code 278.278 - where you check all 3 conditions 281.781 - Training your brain to differentiate between thinking about the solution 284.951 -  and coding it up 286.035 - requires a lot of practice 287.537 - But if you practice enough, 288.83 - you will reach a place where you just have to think about the solution 291.749 - Once you have a clear solution, 293.334 - the coding part will start coming naturally to you. 295.503 - In my interviews, 296.421 - I rarely spend more than 15 minutes on writing the actual code 299.549 - Most of my time goes into thinking about the solution 302.135 - so keep practicing 303.303 - It might take 100 problems for some 305.305 - and 500 for others like me 307.14 - But you will eventually get there. 310.685 - Before we talk about how to know if you are ready for interviews, 313.563 - let\u2019s talk about how to practice 315.648 - And this is where I made my second big mistake 317.817 - And that is 318.609 - I spent way too much time on one problem 320.778 - It was mainly because my ego was very high. How am I not able to solve this problem? 324.991 - Maybe if I give it a little more time? 326.826 - By doing this 327.744 -  I would end up spending upto 3-4 hours on one problem 330.496 - In an interview, 331.372 - you only get 45 minutes to solve a problem 333.75 - Why should your practice session be so different? 335.96 -  In my opinion, 336.919 - if you are not close to the solution in 1 hour, 339.13 - you should give up 340.006 - and spend the rest of the time on looking at the solutions of the others and learning from them 344.052 - So, go to the discussion section, 345.845 - sort the solutions by most votes 347.93 - and read at least the top 3 solutions 349.932 -  I recommend 3 solutions and not just the top one 352.685 - because sometimes 353.978 - the top solution is not  practical for the interviews 356.647 - Try to understand the solution rather than memorizing it 359.4 - because you will not be able to replicate the solution in the interview 362.403 -  After understanding the solution, 364.113 - come back to the editor and code it up yourself. 366.491 - Even if you think you are writing the exact same solution that you just read, 369.952 - do it. 370.578 - That\u2019s because many times, 371.954 - there are some corner cases that you will not be able to see just by reading 375.166 -  And when you hit the test cases that don\u2019t pass, 377.46 - you will appreciate the difference between \u201cless than\u201d and \u201cless than or equal to\u201d much better. 381.631 - But what do you do if you are able to solve the problem? 384.092 - And this is where I made my third and the final mistake 386.803 - After solving a problem, 388.221 - I would just move onto the next question. 390.014 - And that is not the best strategy because your solution might not be optimal 393.476 - It might pass all the test cases 395.269 - but there still might be some better solutions out there 397.688 - I recommend reading the top solutions no matter what. 400.316 - This is especially important if your solution is too lengthy and you think you can not solve problem in the interview time 405.78 - In my opinion, 406.781 - if you are writing a solution that is more than 20 lines of code, 409.742 - There\u2019s a good chance that there\u2019s a better solution out there 412.495 - So, there\u2019s no harm in learning from others 416.29 - Many people ask me how to decide whether they are ready for coding interviews 419.293 - Are 200 problems enough 420.92 - or should I do 500? 422.255 - To be honest, 423.005 - it doesn\u2019t work that way in life 424.674 -  It\u2019s less about how many problems you have solved, 426.843 - and more about how good you are at solving any new problem 429.554 - I believe 430.138 - that we should answer this question from an interview standpoint 432.849 - An interview is usually 45 minutes long 435.017 - and in most interviews, they ask you a Leetcode medium problems 438.062 -  Accounting for the pressure of the interview 439.856 - and adding a buffer for the introductions, 441.774 -  if you can consistently solve Leetcode mediums in less than 30-35 minutes, 445.778 - you are ready to go 446.904 - Reaching this level on Leetcode is impossible 449.115 - if you don\u2019t have a strong foundational knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms 453.202 - To learn how I mastered Data Structures and Algorithms, 455.913 - watch this video 456.789 - My name is Sahil and I will see you in the next one"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: My First LeetCode Experience 0:52 - The Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms 1:25 - Starting with the Right LeetCode Problems 2:00 - How to Approach Problems Strategically 3:00 - Thinking Before Coding: Solving in Two Steps 4:10 - Practicing Effectively and Learning from Mistakes 5:30 - Optimizing Solutions and Avoiding Common Errors 6:30 - Are You Ready for Coding Interviews? 7:00 - Final Thoughts and Next Steps"}]}

We have full amenities; pool, tennis,\u00a0\u00a0 9.78 - paddle ball, pickleball, you know, golf obviously. \u00a0 It's a 18-hole Tom Fazio design Golf Course. 23.16 - My name is Dane Olsen. I'm of the golf course\u00a0\u00a0 25.14 - Superintendent at Thornblade\u00a0 Club in Greer South Carolina. 28.26 - I started working on a golf course in high school.\u00a0 Really enjoyed it, decided that I wanted to pursue\u00a0\u00a0 38.22 - that as a career. Went to North Dakota State\u00a0 University got my bachelor's in Turfgrass 43.98 - Management. And then from there I kind of did\u00a0 some internships across the country. I took my\u00a0\u00a0 49.38 - first assistant superintendent job out of school\u00a0 at Savannah Golf Club in New York. Worked there\u00a0\u00a0 55.08 - for two years and was at Victoria National Golf\u00a0 Club in Indiana for three years. And then my boss\u00a0\u00a0 60.96 - he asked me \"hey, do you want to want to make a move\u00a0 and come down to South Carolina with me?\" and I've\u00a0\u00a0 65.58 - been here now for two years with him. That's kind\u00a0 of kind of where I've been and and what I've done. 78.72 - The uniqueness about this place is the\u00a0 different Turf varieties. It's the difference\u00a0\u00a0 83.82 - going from the C4 to the C3 grasses. Having\u00a0 all Bermuda tees, rough collars, everything.\u00a0\u00a0 89.16 - And then and then going to the bent grass\u00a0 greens, you know, that comes with different\u00a0\u00a0 93.12 - chemicals, different mowing patterns, different\u00a0 mowing heights. We do have you know bunkers 98.1 - in the middle of fairways. We have undulated\u00a0 hills kind of across the properties in some\u00a0\u00a0 102.72 - really tight areas which requires us to, you\u00a0 know, get different machinery such as Ventracs. 122.46 - If we didn't have have Ventrac, maintaining\u00a0 a lot of these areas would be with a line\u00a0\u00a0 127.44 - trimmer which requires more labor, more\u00a0 staffing, and a traditional rough mower. If\u00a0\u00a0 132.84 - you try to go up these hills you're just going\u00a0 to spin and spin and you're going to obviously\u00a0\u00a0 136.14 - rut up areas and and cause turf damage. Where\u00a0 where these Ventracs actually climb on\u00a0\u00a0 141.54 - these slopes and get in these tight areas\u00a0 that a bigger traditional unit can't get\u00a0\u00a0 145.8 - into without sliding and causing damage.\u00a0 Definitely cuts labor and time in half. 168.42 - The Ventrac has definitely been a part\u00a0 of of everywhere that I have worked.\u00a0\u00a0 172.8 - We've had Ventracs. It's my my eighth golf course\u00a0 I've been on across the country. We've had Ventracs\u00a0\u00a0 178.44 - everywhere. Being able to say \"hey, I need a stump\u00a0 grinder attachment.\" It's a lot easier to to come\u00a0\u00a0 184.5 - up and say \"hey, I can get this stump grinder\u00a0 attachment for this machine that I already have\u00a0\u00a0 188.7 - that I can utilize or I'm gonna have to go out and\u00a0 buy this specialty machine there's literally only\u00a0\u00a0 194.82 - able to use for grinding stumps.\" Where this other\u00a0 machine I can put a stump grinder on it but then\u00a0\u00a0 200.64 - again, I can turn around and I can put a rotary\u00a0 deck mower on it, or I could put a real deck on it,\u00a0\u00a0 207.12 - or a blower on it. So I can utilize those you know\u00a0 in many different areas and it's an easy switch. 217.92 - I really you know like the clich\u00e9 everyone says\u00a0 you know they like being outside, they don't want\u00a0\u00a0 222.66 - to be in an office which is which is true with\u00a0 me, but I like working. I like seeing something\u00a0\u00a0 226.92 - different every day. I can be outside all day, you\u00a0 know, it requires a little office work obviously\u00a0\u00a0 231.3 - but most of the time I get to be out here. I get to\u00a0 see the changes we've made. I get to do something\u00a0\u00a0 235.86 - relatively different every single day.

what religion is but I also don't know 12.719 - what art is or what literature is or for 15.719 - that matter what biology is like is 18.4 - studying viruses biology I don't know 21.6 - because I don't know whether viruses are 23.92 -

spiritual I don't go to church but I do 38.84 - follow my star chart I don't practice a 41.2 - religion but I do practice yoga yoga is 44.68 - a fascinating example actually like in 47.48 - 2009 the US state of Missouri's 49.6 - government pushed to reclassify yoga 52.0 - classes not as tax-exempt spiritual 54.559 - practices but as recreational businesses 57.48 - in the same taxable category as gym 60.44 - memberships but a few years later in 62.559 - 2013 some parents in California sued 65.88 - their kids school district arguing that 68.08 - teaching yoga during PE was promoting 70.96 - Hinduism to students so which group was 73.36 - right well that's the thing whether 75.52 - something counts as religious or not 77.92 - often depends on who's asking the 80.04 - question and who benefits from the 82.56 - answer 84.18 - [Music] 92.119 - we' fought Wars over it we've built 94.159 - societies around it we've even pretended 96.479 - that we weren't home when people knocked 98.28 - on our doors about it that's right we 100.36 - have two cameras this time camera two is 102.96 - for silly fun times and camera one is 105.32 - for serious religion business but what 107.64 - even is religion like what unites 109.799 - Hinduism Christianity and wiah under the 112.52 - same umbrella and what sets religions 115.2 - apart from other stuff that people do 117.36 - like reciting the Pledge of Allegiance 119.28 - or wearing the same Jersey every time 121.2 - you watch the world's greatest fourth 122.799 - tier English soccer team well we can 124.479 - think of religions as Frameworks that 126.6 - help people organize shape and make 128.72 - sense of their lives but of course if 130.879 - that's our only definition then is 132.92 - veganism a religion what about 135.319 - capitalism what about organizing your 137.36 - entire life around the exploits of 11 139.56 - 23-year-old men in South London or 141.879 - overidentifying as a Texan like yeah 144.2 - it's a big state it's very impressive 145.84 - but it's not that big of a state I've 147.04 - seen bigger so yeah it's tricky because 149.319 - no sing definition contains all the ways 152.04 - people do religion and the stakes are 154.76 - high here because how we Define what 156.68 - counts as religion and what doesn't has 159.239 - impacts on all our lives whether we're 161.68 - religious or not so when we use the word 164.0 - religion what we often mean is belief in 166.56 - a higher power a trait that English 169.159 - philosopher Lord Herbert of cherbury 172.519 - proposed back in the 17 century as one 174.599 - of the five fundamental truths about 176.519 - religion oh my God I'm so good at 178.519 - pronouncing the names of Lord Lords of 180.159 - cherry like is that a job is 182.159 - mispronouncing British Lord names a job 184.959 - because if so sign me up and to give 187.519 - credit to Lord Herbert it's true that 189.239 - lots of religious Traditions involve 191.04 - gods and goddesses except for the ones 193.36 - that don't of course like many forms of 195.239 - jism and Buddhism which focus on ethical 198.159 - behavior and self- transformation so 201.12 - okay what if we defined it more broadly 203.08 - let's say a religion doesn't have to 204.84 - have a higher power but it needs a 206.76 - shared belief system again for some 209.76 - itions that's fair like for most 211.239 - Christians it's really important that 212.599 - everybody's on the same page about the 214.159 - whole Jesus's savior thing religions 216.48 - with shared beliefs are called credal 218.68 - religions and are often linked to a 220.4 - sacred text but even this broader 222.159 - interpretation doesn't cover everything 224.08 - right like the SoDo Zen School of 225.959 - Buddhism emphasizes action over beliefs 229.04 - building mindful awareness through 230.879 - meditation cooking and caring for other 233.36 - people we sometimes call these votive 236.159 - religions Traditions that stress what 238.0 - people do rather than what they believe 240.92 - and of course many religions focus on 242.599 - belief and action like Islam's emphasis 245.239 - on both correct Doctrine or Orthodoxy 247.76 - and correct practice or orthopraxy and 250.959 - within a religion there can be 252.68 - disagreements profound ones ones seen as 255.599 - worth killing and dying for over this 258.16 - stuff so in truth no single idea unites 261.28 - every religion not belief in God not 263.52 - prayer not prepping for the afterlife 265.72 - the term religion is sort of like the 267.44 - word Sports which lumps together soccer 270.24 - and synchronized swimming and curling 272.479 - and even pickle ball which its adherence 274.919 - genuinely seem to treat like a religion 276.88 - the way we Define religion is specific 278.84 - to the societies we live in just like 281.16 - the practices themselves sociologist 283.8 - Emil durkheim said that religion is a 286.199 - system of beliefs and practices 288.24 - surrounding the sacred basically 290.68 - anything a community has given special 292.72 - meaning to like crucifixes or Landscapes 296.08 - or altars but his definition also leaves 298.56 - a lot of room for other things to be 300.479 - considered sacred like Taylor Swift or 303.0 - Diet Dr Pepper because there's no shared 305.4 - feature of these systems we call 307.56 - religions it's all the more important to 309.96 - be aware of whose interests are served 313.0 - by the definitions we use like a lot of 315.32 - yoga teachers disagreed with Missouri's 317.08 - reclassification of the practice and 318.919 - believed that yoga studios had more in 321.039 - common with churches which don't have to 323.199 - pay sales tax arguing that yoga is more 325.639 - than exercise and can't be separated 327.72 - from its spiritual ties but in the Cali 330.12 - case the judge acknowledged that yoga is 332.479 - religious yes but ruled this kind of 334.96 - yoga wasn't religious enough not in the 338.0 - way school kids were learning to do it 339.639 - anyway for one thing the kids called the 341.12 - Lotus position crisscross applesauce and 343.36 - you can tell that's not a joke because 344.96 - we're staying at camera one they 346.68 - literally called it crisscross 348.28 - applesauce so how did we get to this 350.12 - point was there ever a time when 351.52 - religion was simple or 353.72 - straightforward not really in the United 355.8 - States today we often use the word 357.36 - religion to imply a special sphere of 360.039 - society set apart from the rest of life 362.6 - it's sort of separate from politics or 364.759 - culture or the economy but also overlaps 367.4 - with all of them in many ways including 370.08 - that I don't want to hear my uncle's 371.72 - opinions about any of them at 373.28 - Thanksgiving dinner which is also not a 375.12 - joke but until just a few centuries ago 377.199 - most languages didn't have a word for 379.28 - the kind of religion we're talking about 381.28 - in this series like the Arabic word Dean 383.56 - originally meant custom or law but when 385.84 - it appears in the Quran it sometimes 387.56 - gets translated into English as religion 390.319 - which is kind of like interpreting an 391.919 - ancient word for horse to mean car an 395.16 - invention that didn't exist yet even the 397.28 - Latin word religio originally just meant 399.72 - rules at a time when many Roman emperors 402.08 - were seen as Divine like Caesar's law 405.16 - was God's law the idea of religion as a 408.28 - private personal belief system traces 410.68 - back to a very specific time and place 413.08 - 16th century Western Europe during the 415.84 - Protestant Reformation Christians 417.52 - disagreed over how much Authority the 419.639 - church should have and whether it was 421.599 - valid for the church to sell indulgences 424.28 - which were these like little pieces of 425.8 - paper that let people off the hook if 427.479 - they donated to the church building fund 429.72 - Martin Luther the guy who kicked off the 431.28 - Reformation by purportedly nailing 95 433.56 - hot takes to a church door radically 435.759 - argued for a separation of church and 438.44 - state basically he thought that the 440.24 - government should worry about stuff on 441.919 - Earth and let the church handle the 444.0 - afterlife this idea served Protestants 446.16 - interests as it broadened Christianity 447.96 - to allow ideas and practices other than 450.199 - those okayed by the Pope the shot callar 453.199 - Big Boss yes chef of European religious 455.879 - Authority the Reformation also redefined 458.52 - the everyday meaning of religion in 460.919 - Western Europe as a personal private 463.84 - relationship with the Divine and it 465.919 - wasn't long before Europeans took this 467.599 - model of religion on the road during the 469.759 - colonial era between the 15th and 20th 471.8 - centuries Europeans encountered other 473.879 - ways of doing religion while colonizing 476.0 - cultures in Asia Africa Oceana and the 478.639 - Americas and they found that many 480.72 - indigenous people's Traditions related 482.8 - to their ancestors or the land rather 485.56 - than a deity for example native Hawaiian 487.639 - honor the sacredness of the Mona volcano 490.159 - considered to be the physical embodiment 492.319 - of the Gods as well as amua or ancestral 495.759 - spirits who provide families with 497.44 - guidance but that didn't Vibe with 499.159 - European thought which assumed religions 501.36 - to be Christianity shaped with a Founder 503.8 - sacred texts clergy rituals and a church 507.039 - now we're going to explore more of what 509.039 - stem from that in our next episode but 511.199 - for now what's important to know is that 513.32 - this prevailing model of religion hasn't 516.159 - always existed it served very particular 519.32 - interests in 16th century Western Europe 522.12 - as it does now prioritizing some 524.64 - traditions over others and this has 526.88 - tangible impacts outside of the 528.959 - religious sphere like calling something 530.88 - a religion can come with some distinctly 533.399 - Earthly perks like tax exemption and 535.68 - legal protection and baptismal hot tubs 538.399 - and when this label gets denied to some 540.32 - traditions that can create real life 542.64 - consequences many countries today have 544.72 - laws protecting religious freedom or the 547.56 - right to follow the religion of your 549.2 - choice but how those countries Define 551.64 - religion determines who is actually 553.959 - afforded that freedom for example the 556.0 - Chinese Constitution officially grants 558.0 - legal protections to normal religious 560.32 - activities but since 2017 the government 563.04 - has detained over 1 million Wagers and 565.839 - other turkic Muslims in re-education 568.16 - camps in India a controversial 2019 law 571.0 - created a FasTrack to citizenship for 573.079 - refugees from some religious groups but 576.36 - specifically excluded Muslims and 578.92 - governments have sometimes weaponized 580.64 - their classifications of religion as a 582.519 - way to demonize control and exclude 584.959 - certain people often religious practices 587.399 - that aren't officially recognized are 589.24 - deemed illegitimate or illegal like many 591.8 - Rastafari adherents have been 593.36 - incarcerated for smoking marijuana a 595.72 - substance they view as a Sacrament but 598.2 - one that's criminalized in many 599.839 - countries from the UK to Cuba in North 602.64 - Korea where unauthorized religious 604.399 - activity is prohibited Christians and 606.48 - followers of Korean folk religion have 608.36 - been arrested tortured and even executed 611.04 - by the government the big takeaway here 613.04 - is that there's no single way of doing 615.519 - religion no defining quality that unites 618.32 - these practices but that's what makes it 620.72 - so important to be conscious of the 622.8 - definitions we're using and aware of 625.44 - who's policing their boundaries I'll 627.839 - leave you with one more slightly J azi 629.72 - definition from the philosopher and 631.48 - theologian Paul tilik who called 633.56 - religion the state of being grasped by 636.32 - an ultimate concern and throughout this 638.839 - series we'll find no single idea about 641.639 - what that ultimate concern is the shape 644.32 - it takes or how we're grasped by it 647.48 - there are many ways people Define and 649.68 - debate religion contest it and make 651.959 - sense of it practice it and live it over 654.959 - the course of this series we're going to 656.44 - try to make sense of some of them 658.519 - together but this idea of an ultimate 661.279 - concern a belief or series of beliefs 664.32 - that structures and animates your life 667.04 - can be a very valuable thing to have and 670.32 - of course it can be dangerous too I 673.72 - wonder if you have an ultimate concern 676.519 - or I guess more to the point if you're 679.279 - conscious of what your ultimate concern 681.639 - is and how beliefs and practices in your 684.72 - life tend to that ultimate concern in 687.76 - our next episode we'll ask how many 689.8 - religions are there and again find out 692.44 - that the answer is complicated I'll see 695.48 -

this video then let it be this the 69.96 - amount of money you make is always 71.92 - directly proportional to the amount of 73.72 - perceived value you give to put it 75.96 - simply the bigger the problems you're 77.96 - able to solve the more money you'll make 80.2 - and the faster you'll Bridge the 82.079 - performance Gap so the first thing I 83.96 - want you to do is draw out a VIN diagram 86.159 - like this in this section I want you to 88.4 - write down the things you like to do do 90.24 - so if I was doing this I'll put down 92.24 - racing cars flying planes traveling and 96.28 - playing golf I'm sure you have a lot of 98.32 - others you can add so just go crazy with 101.0 - it in this next one write down the 102.72 - things you're good at off the top of my 104.68 - head I'd say having conversations 106.96 - building and designing models leading 109.32 - teams and carpentry and finally write 112.04 - down the things that people will pay you 113.68 - a lot for let's put down Consulting 116.28 - building structures and designing 118.52 - complex mechanics the Trap that most 120.759 - people fall into is only considering one 122.799 - of these factors when they're deciding 124.479 - what they want to do with their life I 126.119 - mean imagine choosing a job just because 128.319 - you love it but you're stuck making 130.039 - minimum wage and before you know it 132.16 - you're hating what you once loved talk 135.12 - about a passion killer or picture this 137.56 - you're good at something so you make it 139.44 - your job but you're working your fingers 141.68 - to the Bone and still not making enough 143.56 - money you're stuck in your comfort zone 146.239 - not really going anywhere and then 148.0 - there's this scenario where you pick a 149.519 - job just because it pays well which 152.08 - sounds good right well not if you're 154.319 - miserable every single day that's why 156.519 - the only solution to becoming rich and 158.84 - happy is to find something that's in all 161.56 - sections I call this the value Zone I 165.48 - managed to find this early on by 166.879 - combining my passion for model 168.319 - helicopters with my skill for building 170.44 - models and advice people would pay for 173.08 - this led me to opening multiple model 174.92 - shops and designing my own brand of 176.72 - models that I sold across the globe the 179.239 - problem with the way way most people 180.56 - look at business is they want to find 182.319 - the side hustle or the method first and 184.959 - then try to fit themselves around it 186.959 - rather than nailing down their value 189.04 - Zone and then finding the correct side 191.08 - hustle to start for them so now you know 193.28 - how to find your value Zone it's time to 195.48 - pick the right vehicle to drive you in a 197.68 - straight line to your 199.67 - [Music] 201.56 - destination let me ask you a question 204.04 - would you rather have a million dollar 205.72 - in assets or earn a million dollar per 208.239 - year think about that for a second of 210.76 - course you want both right well to do 212.92 - this you're going to need two different 214.72 - Vehicles one for making money and the 217.879 - other one for investing money let's 220.519 - start with making money this should be 222.519 - your active vehicle think of it like a 225.159 - motorbike you can choose between a 227.08 - product based business like I started a 229.84 - Content business like making YouTube 232.2 - videos and my alltime favorite a 234.799 - service-based business so why is a 237.28 - service-based business my favorite when 240.36 - I produce products and also make YouTube 243.159 - videos might seem a bit strange right 245.72 - one word timing and I'm not talking 248.04 - about time in the market but instead 250.319 - your career timing your initial side 252.879 - hustle should have the potential to rake 254.68 - in about 100K a year but remember the 257.759 - Venture that catapults you to 1 million 259.919 - or even 10 million a year is not going 262.52 - to be the same when you're starting 265.04 - resources are usually pretty tight so 267.479 - it's smarter to launch a service-based 269.32 - business business as it has minimal 271.36 - setup costs even better if you could do 273.88 - it from a laptop in your spare time so 275.96 - take a look at your diagram again and 278.32 - brainstorm a service you can offer 280.68 - within your value zone now for investing 283.44 - money this should be your passive 285.28 - vehicle think of it like the side car on 287.68 - your motorbike you know like the one in 290.0 - Harry Potter loads of people treat inves 292.24 - in like it's just another side hustle 294.52 - chasing it with that same getrich quick 296.919 - mindset but here's the real deal 299.88 - investing isn't about overnight riches 302.88 - it's a tool to grow your wealth and if 305.56 - you do it right you can just set it and 308.199 - forget it after you've made your free 310.16 - account all you have to do is Select 312.56 - pies these pies represent different 314.8 - slices of stock for instance if you have 317.52 - a pie with 25% Tesla 25% meta and say 322.759 - 50% Google and you invest $100 it will 326.52 - be divided amongst those stocks this 328.72 - means $25 $ would go into both Tesla and 332.6 - meta and $50 would go into Google you 335.96 - can choose to make these Investments at 337.52 - a frequency that suits you daily weekly 340.52 - or monthly let's set one up together so 342.68 - you can follow this video step by step 344.919 - you have the option to use pre-made pies 348.479 - and there's lots of options in here such 350.479 - as this one that focuses on companies 353.039 - that pay dividends and this one here 356.4 - that invest in AI companies although 359.0 - this looks simple please always do your 361.0 - own research into stocks you want to 363.12 - invest in rather than just trusting the 365.44 - P creators this pre-made option is great 368.24 - to give you some ideas but I encourage 370.639 - you to make your own so let's go back to 372.599 - select build a custom pie now you can 375.919 -

money generating vehicle and set up your 479.159 - pass Investment app it's time to think 481.56 - about the next 483.02 - [Music] 485.08 - section one of the biggest lies gurus 487.879 - tell you is that you need seven 489.919 - different income streams to become 491.56 - successful and reach your end goal this 494.12 - causes people to get so caught up 495.72 - juggling multiple income sources and 498.0 - their social lives that they end up 499.919 - slowing down and losing their focus 502.24 - completely you have three main limited 504.56 - resources money time and energy if you 508.159 - want to do this with me grab a piece of 510.0 - paper and three different colored pens 512.24 - firstly make a list of everything you do 514.44 - in your life this should include 517.039 - everything now draw a graph like this 519.0 - and divide it into segments 520.519 - corresponding to the number of items on 522.36 - your list for my example that would be 524.959 - six segments but for you it could be 527.279 - more or less first use a color to shade 530.2 - in the proportion of money you spend on 532.8 - each segment every month then use a 534.959 - different color to shade in the amount 536.48 - of time you spend on each activity 539.04 - monthly lastly use yet another color to 542.44 - show the amount of energy each task 544.64 - requires you should have something that 546.64 - looks a bit like this here's the key 548.959 - your resources will always be limited 551.6 - while it might be possible to increase 553.2 - the amount of money you have increasing 555.399 - your energy and especially your time 557.68 - just isn't possible when I do this 559.48 - activity with people it's amazing how 561.36 - much they spread their resources to all 563.399 - different areas of their life now I do 565.92 - get work life balance but when you're 568.32 - trying to build your wealth at a quick 570.32 - Pace you really can't spread yourself 572.64 - too thinly when I was building my first 574.72 - business I put my head down and I worked 577.2 - like crazy when I snapped out of it I'd 580.04 - lost a last chunk of my social life I 582.48 - was out of shape and I hadn't spent very 584.68 - much time with my family now was that 586.68 - healthy probably not but did it make me 590.56 - successful very I devoted all of my 593.44 - resources towards a single business for 595.68 - an extended period once I achieved my 598.2 - dream of becoming a milliona in air I 600.04 - began to restore balance to my life 602.68 - however in the early days when I lack 604.88 - money and a team any distraction could 607.56 - have derailed my efforts focus is 609.68 - underrated nowadays I see so many 612.32 - motivated youngsters jumping from side 615.0 - hustle to side hustle falling for 617.279 - something that's known as shiny object 619.76 - syndrome if I constantly switch business 622.0 - model every time something got a little 623.64 - bit difficult then I'd have kept going 625.44 - back to square one and never made any 627.68 - real progression so have a look at your 629.36 - your graph of Truth and ask yourself 631.6 - could you give up any of the things that 633.32 - you're spending time on and allocate 635.519 - your resources elsewhere looking at this 637.88 - example I'll get rid of Tik Tok Xbox and 640.639 - dating straight away now look how much 643.12 - more time money and energy I can 646.32 - allocate to side hustles this will 648.56 - dramatically reduce the time it takes 650.44 - for you to achieve your 653.04 - [Music] 654.399 - dreams there's a great quote by Jim Ron 657.2 - that goes like this if you really want 659.399 - to do something you'll find a way if you 662.079 - don't you find an excuse so if you want 665.16 - to close the performance Gap then you 667.0 - need to understand the difference 668.279 - between obstacles and excuses this is 671.279 - you and these are your dreams between 673.92 - you and your dreams are obstacles and 676.36 - these are what you need to overcome to 678.399 - make your dreams into reality looking 680.88 - back on my younger years boy did I have 683.0 - it rough I was dyslexic and my teachers 686.079 - would often label me as lazy and stupid 688.76 - I left with no qualifications to fall 691.32 - back on and when I finally entered the 693.279 - workforce I was bullied by my manager 695.88 - these were the huge obstructions between 698.32 - me and my dreams but I never allowed 701.56 - them to be my excuses you may also be 704.079 - facing huge obstacles in your life but 706.44 - you must make it your mission to 708.12 - overcome them in order to achieve your 710.76 - dreams because if you don't then those 712.839 - obstacles become the excuses that block 714.92 - the path to your dreams and then you're 717.16 - just left staring at your biggest excuse 719.2 - exuses with your dreams just out of 721.76 - sight excuses not obstacles are the 724.8 - single biggest reason for people never 727.24 - closing the performance Gap whenever 729.2 - someone says to me I can't do something 731.959 - I say this I know you can't right now 735.12 - but if you could what would you do if 737.68 - you're ever facing an obstacle that 739.399 - seems impossible to overcome try and ask 742.199 - yourself the same question come up with 744.92 - lots of different solutions and write 747.16 - them all down the next step is to try 749.48 - those Solutions you might find that many 751.72 - of them don't work but persist and you 754.36 - will eventually 756.08 - [Music] 774.199 - succeed if you've been watching my 776.199 - channel for a while then you've probably 777.8 -

of the world he who understands it earns 794.16 - it he who doesn't pays it I've shown in 797.04 - the past how true this is for investing 799.079 - money but this is even more important 801.36 - when it comes to your knowledge bank 803.279 - account most people fail to bridge the 805.24 - last section of the performance Gap 807.16 - because when they leave school they stop 809.12 - St learning let me show you why this is 811.0 - a huge mistake these initial blocks 813.48 -

disappear after 1 hour but I found the 20.84 - underlying Concepts actually made me 22.8 - better at using tools like Chachi BT and 25.16 - Google bard and cleared up a bunch of 27.599 - misconceptions I didn't know I had about 30.32 - AI machine learning and large language 33.0 - models so starting with the broadest 35.2 - possible question what is artificial 37.52 - intelligence it turns out and I'm so 39.32 - embarrassed to admit I didn't know this 41.079 - AI is an entire field of study like 43.76 - physics and machine learning is a 45.96 - subfield of AI much like how 48.28 - thermodynamics is a subfield of physics 51.8 - going down another level deep learning 53.68 - is a subset of machine learning and deep 55.76 - learning models can be further broken 57.559 - down into something called 58.84 - discriminative models and generative 61.199 - models large language models llms also 64.479 - fall under deep learning and right at 66.479 - the intersection between generative and 68.52 - llms is the technology that powers the 71.36 - applications we're all familiar with 73.4 - chat gbt and Google bard let me know in 75.92 - the comments if this was news to you as 77.68 - well now that we have an understanding 79.24 - of the overall landscape and you see how 81.32 - the different disciplines sit in 82.799 - relation to each other let's go over the 85.159 - key takeaways you should know for each 87.479 - level in a nutshell machine learning is 89.56 - a program that uses input data to train 92.72 - a model that trained model can then make 95.399 - predictions Based on data it has never 98.0 - seen before for example if you train a 100.28 - model based on Nike sales data you can 102.6 - then use that model to predict how well 104.92 - a new shoe from Adidas would sell based 107.119 - on Adidas sales data two of the most 109.6 - common types of machine learning models 111.56 - are supervised and unsupervised learning 114.52 - models the key difference between the 116.36 - two is supervised models use labeled 118.88 - data and unsupervised models use 121.6 - unlabeled data in this supervised 124.0 - example we have historical data points 125.88 - that plot the total bill amount at a 127.68 - restaurant against the tip amount and 130.119 - here the data is labeled Blue Dot equals 133.04 - the order was picked up and yellow dot 135.2 - equals the order was delivered using a 137.84 - supervised learning model we can now 139.76 - predict how much tip we can expect for 141.599 - the next order given the bill amount and 144.2 - whether it's picked up or delivered for 146.36 - unsupervised learning models we look at 148.2 - the raw data and see if a naturally 150.48 - falls into groups in this example we 153.08 - plotted the employee tenure at a company 155.72 - against their income we see this group 157.879 - of employees have a relatively High 159.959 - income to years work ratio versus this 162.56 - group we can also see all these are 164.64 - unlabeled data if they were labeled we 167.159 - would see male female years worked 170.159 - company function Etc we can now ask this 173.08 - unsupervised learning model to solve a 174.879 - problem like if a new employee joins are 177.4 - they on the FasTrack or not if they 179.48 - appear on on the left then yes if they 181.8 - appear on the right then no Pro tip 184.319 - another big difference between the two 185.599 - models is that after a supervised 187.599 - learning model makes a prediction it 189.64 - will compare that prediction to the 191.239 - training data used to train that model 193.959 - and if there's a difference it tries to 196.2 - close that Gap unsupervised learning 198.68 - models do not do this by the way this 200.84 - video is not sponsored but it is 202.48 - supported by those of you who subscribe 204.0 - to my paid productivity newsletter on 205.799 - Google tips Link in the description if 207.84 - you want to learn more now we have a 209.28 - basic Gra as of machine learning it's a 211.599 - good time to talk about deep learning 213.64 - which is just a type of machine learning 215.519 - that uses something called artificial 217.799 - neural networks don't worry all you have 220.2 - to know for now is that artificial 221.68 - neural networks are inspired by the 223.64 - human brain and looks something like 226.12 - this layers of nodes and neurons and the 229.159 - more layers there are the more powerful 231.599 - the model and because we have these 233.12 - neural networks we can now do something 234.879 - called semisupervised learning whereby a 237.879 - deep learning model is trained on a 239.84 - small amount of labeled data and a large 242.4 - amount of unlabeled data for example a 244.76 - bank might use deep learning models to 246.599 - detect fraud the bank spends a bit of 248.879 - time to tag or label 5% of transactions 251.56 - as either fraudulent or not fraudulent 254.239 - and they leave the remaining 95% of 256.079 - transactions unlabeled because they 257.72 - don't have the time or resources to 259.56 - label every transaction the magic 262.199 - happens when the Deep learning model 263.96 - uses the 5% of label data to learn the 266.6 - basic concepts of the task okay these 268.52 - transactions are good and these are bad 270.52 - okay apply those learnings to the 272.36 - remaining 95% of unlabeled data and 275.16 - using this new aggregate data set the 277.919 - model makes predictions for future 280.4 - transactions that's pretty cool and 282.4 - we're not done because deep learning can 284.0 - be divided into two types discriminative 286.72 - and generative models discriminative 289.56 - models learn from the relationship 291.16 - between labels of data points and only 294.12 - has the ability to classify those data 296.36 - points fraud not fraud for example you 299.199 - have a bunch of pictures or data points 301.72 - you purposefully label some of them as 303.8 - cats and some of them as dogs a 306.32 - discriminative model will learn from the 308.24 - label cat or dog and if you submit a 310.96 - picture of a dog it will predict the 313.12 - label for that new data point a dog we 316.039 - finally get to generative AI unlike 318.36 - discriminative models generative models 320.28 - learn about the patterns in the training 322.08 - data then after they receive some input 324.68 - for example a text prompt from us they 326.919 - generate something new based on the 328.759 - patterns they just learned going back to 331.039 - the animal example the pictures or data 333.52 - points are not labeled as cater doog so 336.319 - a generative model will look for 337.919 - patterns oh these data points all have 340.16 - two ears four legs a tail likes dog food 343.28 - and Barks when as to generate something 345.96 - called a dog the generative model 348.4 - generates a completely new image based 351.479 - on the patterns it just learned there's 353.8 - a super simple way to determine if 355.56 - something is generative AI or not if the 357.84 - output is a number a class ification 360.319 - spam not spam or a probability it is not 364.12 - generative AI it is Gen AI when the 366.72 - output is natural language text or a 369.08 - speech an image or audio basically 372.599 - generative AI generates new samples that 375.28 - are similar to the data it was trained 378.24 - on moving on to different generative AI 380.4 - model types most of us are familiar with 382.919 - textto text models like Chach BT and 385.24 - Google bard other common model types 387.56 - include text to image models like midj 390.08 - Dolly and stable diffusion these can not 393.08 - only generate images but edit images as 396.16 - well text to video models surprise 398.08 - surprise can generate and edit video 400.36 - footage examples include Google's 402.319 - imageen video Cog video and the Very 404.639 - creatively named make a video text to 3D 407.72 - models are used to create game assets 409.68 - and a little known example would be open 411.68 - ai's shape e model and finally text to 414.84 - task models are trained to perform a 416.759 - specific task for example if you type 419.68 - Gmail summarize my unread emails Google 422.12 - bard will look through your inbox and 424.0 - summarize your unread emails moving over 426.68 - to large language models don't forget 428.4 - that llms are also a subset of deep 430.96 - learning and although there is some 433.039 - overlap llms and geni are not the same 437.4 - thing an important distinction is that 439.12 - large language models are generally 441.24 - pre-trained with a very large set of 443.599 - data and then fine-tune for specific 446.56 - purposes what does that mean imagine you 448.72 - have a pet dog it can be pre-trained 450.639 - with basic commands like sit come down 453.28 - and stay it's a good boy and a 455.28 - generalist but if that same good boy 457.8 - goes on to become a police dog a guide 459.8 - dog or hunting dog they need to receive 462.44 - specific training so they're fine tuned 465.879 - for that specialist role a similar idea 468.8 - applies to large language models they're 471.36 - first pre-trained to solve common 473.639 - language problems like text 475.199 - classification question answering 477.479 - document summarization and text 479.639 - generation then using smaller industry 482.479 - specific data sets these llms are 485.28 - fine-tuned to solve specific problems in 487.919 - Retail Finance Healthcare entertainment 491.159 - and other fields in the real world this 493.52 - might mean a hospital uses a pre-trained 496.12 - large language model from one of the big 498.199 - tech companies and fine-tunes that model 500.68 - with its own first-party medical data to 503.52 - improve diagnostic accuracy from X-rays 505.96 - and other medical tests this is a 508.28 - win-win scenario because large companies 510.159 - can spend billions developing general 512.12 - purpose large language models then sell 514.56 - those llms to smaller institutions like 517.0 - retail companies Banks hospitals who 519.44 - don't have the resources to develop 521.279 - their own large language models but they 524.159 - have the domain specific data sets to 526.839 - fine-tune those models Pro tip if you do 529.44 - end up taking the full course I'll link 530.8 - it down below it's completely free when 532.56 - you're taking notes you can right click 534.36 - on the video player and copy video URL 536.8 - at the current time so can quickly 538.64 - navigate back to that specific part of 540.839 - the video there are five modules total 542.88 - and you get a badge after completing 544.6 - each module the content overall is a bit 547.399 - more on the theoretical side so you 548.839 - definitely want to check out this video 550.2 - on how to master prompting next see you 552.68 - on the next video in the 554.079 - meantime have a great one"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

YES.  63.296 - >> SO DUVAL COUNTY PUBLIC  63.93 - SCHOOLS, WE HAVE 68 CAREER  64.631 - ACADEMIES AND WE HAVE SEVERAL  65.331 - COURSES AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL  67.3 - LEVEL AND THEN ALSO  67.834 - OPPORTUNITIES AT THE  70.203 - ELEMENTARY LEVEL. TO YOUR  71.404 - POINT, I THINK WE USED TO CALL  72.739 - IT VOCATNAL UCATN AN 73.406 - IT REALLY EVOLVED THEIR  76.743 - OPPORTUNITIES IN 17 DIFFERENT  79.512 - INDUSTRIES. YOU MENTIONED  80.213 - MEDICAL IN THE PREVIOUS HOUR  84.15 - AND CULINARY AUTOMOTIVE IT. SO  86.086 - WE HAVE JUST LOTS OF  87.12 - OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS. I  89.923 - THINK I AVIATION,  92.025 - CYBERSECURITY, LANDSCAPING,  94.06 - DIGITAL MARKETING, DIARY  94.694 - GAMING SOMEWHERE. IS THAT  96.062 - RIGHT? GAME DESIGN, ALL THAT'S  96.796 - VERY POPULAR. S.  98.898 - >> AND I THINK THE BIGGEST  99.566 - MISCONCEPTION TO IS THAT THESE  102.969 - PROGRAMS ARE FOR STUDENTS NOT  103.67 - GOING TO COLLEGE. AND THAT'S  104.37 - FAR FROM E TRH.AS Y SEE 107.04 - OUR MEDICAL STUDENTS, IF  107.674 - THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE  108.341 - NEXT LEVEL, THEY HAVE TO  110.81 - CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION. BUT  111.544 - THESE STUDENTS ARE THESE.  112.212 - THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR ALL  115.315 - STUDENTS. AND WE REALLY WANT  116.015 - TO MAKE SURE OUR FAMILIES KNOW  118.384 - THAT.

TRY IT WHEN YOU HAVE ANY  128.428 - OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THIS IN THE  129.729 - BUSINESS COMMUNITY, IT REALLY  130.797 - GIVES YOU AN IDEA OF WELL, I  132.365 - THOUGHT I WANT TO DO THIS AND  133.099 - NOW I'M IN AN ONLINE DON'T  137.37 - KNOW OR I LOVE THIS. AND THIS  138.538 - ME AN IDEA OF WHAT I WANT TO  139.706 - DO BAUSEE REALLY NEED TO  141.574 - BE 17 YEAR OLDS TO TELL US  142.575 - THAT THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT  143.877 - THEY WANT TO DO WHEN THEY GROW  147.213 - THEY DON'T GET THAT AND IT'S A  147.947 - SAFE SPACE. WE TELL OUR  148.581 - STUDENTS ALL THE TIME. IF.  152.685 - >> IF THEY FIND OUT THIS IS  153.353 - WHAT THEY LOVE OR IF THEY FIND  154.087 - OUT. THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY  154.787 - LOVE. BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE  155.522 - WINDS AND OUR BOOK BECAUSE I  156.322 - DON'T WANT OUR STUDENTS GOING  159.259 - TO COLLEGE SPENDING THEIR  160.26 - MONEY AND THEN FINDING OUT  161.027 - THIS ISN'T FOR THEM OR ENDING  162.362 - UP IN A CAREER THAT THEY'RE  163.029 - NOT IN LOVE WITH. SO IT'S  165.098 - REALLY A SAFE SPACE FOR THEM  165.798 - TO TRY DIFFERENT THINGS. FIND  168.868 - OUT A LOT ABOUT THEMSELVES AS  170.77 - USE OUR STUDENTS IN THE VIDEO  173.373 - LF-ARENE COIDENCE. ALL  174.04 - OF THOSE THINGS ARE BUILT IN  175.441 - THESE PROGRAMS AND REALLY JUST  176.709 - HELP THEM FOR SUCCESS. AFTER  179.212 - HIGH SCHOOL. YEAH, THERE'S  179.879 - SOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS,  181.581 - RIGHT? CAN YOU EXPLAIN THOSE  182.315 - FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS? ALL OF  184.484 - OUR OUR PROGRAMS START IN 9TH  185.485 - GRADE AND THEY ARE OPEN TO ALL  187.32 - STUDENTS. HOWEVER, PROGRAMS  188.755 - LIKE THE CNA PROGRAM DO HAVE  190.69 - REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE  191.391 - REGULATED BY THE FLORIDA BOARD  193.693 - OF NURSING THESE PROGRAMS ARE  194.861 - INDUSTRY STANDARD, RIGHT? SO  195.562 - WE ARE NOT PREPARING THEM IN A  199.299 - WAY THAT THEY WON'T BE  199.933 - SUCCESSFUL THEIR CAREER. SO WE  203.036 - HAVE TO FOR SOME OF THE  203.67 - PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO RIGOROUS  204.938 - REQUIREMENTS SO THAT THEY WILL  207.774 - BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN THEY  208.975 - PARTICIPATE. BUT FOR THOSE,  209.642 - FOR EXAMPLE, WHO THINK, WELL,  212.045 - I'M KIND OF INTERESTED IN THIS  212.779 - AND THEN THEY GET INTO A LIFE  213.88 - MAYBE AFTER 9TH GRADE LIKE I  215.949 - DON'T, ARE THEY ABLE TO YEAH.  216.683 - AND I MEAN, IDEALLY, WE WANT  217.383 - THEM TO COMMIT.  221.521 - >>JENNIFER WAUGH: BECAUSE THEN  222.255 - THEY'RE REALLY ENGAGED IN IN  222.956 - THE PROGRAM AND GET MORE  223.59 - EXPERIENCE IS THE WE'RE NOT  226.192 - GONNA EVER FORCE A STUDENT TO  226.926 - STAY INTO SOMETHING THAT THEY  227.66 - DON'T LOVE. SO THERE ARE  228.995 - OPTIONS. AND ARE THEY ONLY  230.196 - OFFERED AT CERTAIN SCHOOLS?  232.332 - HOW DOES THAT WORK IN TERMS OF  233.166 - THE CAREER ACADEMIES HAVE  235.134 - CAREER ACADEMIES AT EVERY  236.135 - SINGLE HIGH SCHOOL? AND THAT'S  236.903 - SOMETHING I THINK WE ARE VERY  237.604 - PROUD OF. IN DCPS STUDENTS.  241.507 - >>JENNIFER WAUGH: HAVE A WIDE  242.208 - RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES, BUT  242.909 - THERE'S SOMETHING AT EVERY  243.576 - HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN FOR THOSE  244.41 - PROGRAMS THAT ARE A LITTLE  245.111 - HARDER TO REPLICATE LIKE  248.114 - AUTOMOTIVE COSMETOLOGY, THOSE  250.216 - ARE AT OUR TO MAGNET SCHOOL.  251.05 - SO A PHILIP RANDOLPH AND FRANK  253.553 - H PETERSON AND THOSE CAREER  254.287 - ACADEMIES YOU APPLY FOR  254.887 - THROUGH THE SCHOOL CHOICE  259.392 - PROGRAM.

You're looking at 60 satellites 2.31 - hurtling into the sky. 4.41 - And over the next few decades, 6.05 - Elon Musk is hoping to send 42,000 8.766 - of these satellites to space, 10.62 - 15 times the number of operational 12.63 - satellites in orbit today. 14.455 - It's part of Starlink, 15.83 - the expansive constellation from Musk and SpaceX 19.01 - that hopes to bring the world 20.21 - low-latency high-speed internet, 22.36 - promising no more buffering 23.85 - and nearly instantaneous internet 25.91 - in every corner of the world. 27.84 - But experts worry it may come 29.582 - at a hefty cost for space exploration. 32.97 - Nearly half of the world's population 34.97 - does not have access to the internet, 37.04 - because most internet options 38.61 - require an extensive track of costly underground cables, 42.06 - leaving many rural locations offline. 44.66 - And while satellite internet can reach those areas... 47.238 - Dave Mosher: Traditional satellite internet 48.5 - is provided by a bus-sized spacecraft 50.91 - that is launched 22,236 miles 54.937 - into space in orbit around Earth. 56.997 - Narrator: That distance means the satellite 58.47 - can reach places that cables can't. 60.53 - But since that one satellite 62.11 - is meant to service a lot of people, 63.87 - its data capability is limited, 65.87 - which then limits connection speeds. 68.08 - And that signal has to travel a long way, 70.65 - creating a lot of lag. 72.81 - This is where Elon Musk and SpaceX come in. 75.576 - Mosher: Starlink is a globe-encircling network 79.8 - of internet-beaming satellites 81.67 - that is trying to get you online 83.65 - no matter where you are in the world. 85.975 - Narrator: And there's a rather persuading element 87.683 - for SpaceX as well. 89.4 - Mosher: Elon Musk has said he's just trying to grab 91.023 - a small percentage of a trillion-dollar-a-year 93.89 - telecommunications industry around the world. 96.51 - If SpaceX can pull this off, 98.3 - the company could net about $30 to $50 billion a year. 102.0 - Narrator: Musk and SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell 104.64 - say that much money could single-handedly 106.78 - fund the development of Starlink, Starship, 109.45 - and SpaceX's Mars-launch infrastructure. 112.52 - As of early October, 113.937 - SpaceX has launched more than 700 satellites into orbit, 117.48 - with a plan to release a total of 12,000 119.95 - over the next five years, 121.27 - half of them by the end of 2024. 123.68 - And Musk wants to add another 30,000 to that, 126.75 - coming to a total of 42,000 satellites circling Earth. 131.21 - All of these satellites will also be much closer, 134.186 - anywhere from 200 to 400 miles 136.45 - above the planet in low-Earth orbit. 138.59 - Mosher: This reduces the connection delay 141.008 - that is found with traditional internet satellite. 143.05 - Narrator: Once in orbit, 143.907 - these Starlink satellites will be constantly on the move, 146.43 - which is why so many are necessary. 148.52 - Mosher: The problem is you have to have many satellites 151.56 - orbiting to make up for the fact that 153.19 - you can't stay in one spot above the Earth. 155.393 - Because you need several satellites overhead 158.16 - at any one time to cover many users. 160.62 - Narrator: Every satellite will connect 161.81 - with several others via laser beams, 164.05 - creating something like the network's backbone. 166.55 - And to actually bring this internet into your home, 168.986 - you'll need to get a pizza-sized antenna. 171.6 - This phased-array antenna can aim its beam 173.8 - at whatever satellite is overhead, 175.55 - which will maintain an internet signal in your home. 177.86 - But this scheme isn't without problems. 180.27 - Starlink satellites are bright. 182.45 - They reflect the sunlight and shine it back towards Earth, 185.15 - so they end up looking like bright moving stars. 188.38 - As cool as it may look, that comes with problems. 191.565 - Mosher: Starlink satellites are most visible 193.37 - in the night sky right before dawn and right after dusk, 196.73 - which is the exact time that astronomers 198.68 - are hunting for near-Earth objects or asteroids, 201.62 - objects that could hit Earth and possibly harm us. 204.73 - Narrator: And as more satellites go up, 206.17 - so does the likelihood that 207.56 - they'll interfere with astronomers' views. 209.87 - Mosher: If Starlink continues to be a problem 211.61 - for these type of sky surveys, 213.828 - we may not have as much notice as we want 215.968 - to detect a near-Earth object 217.59 - and thwart it and prevent it from hitting Earth. 220.29 - Narrator: Beyond detecting deadly asteroids, 222.448 - the wall of satellites could also obstruct 224.42 - the search for new planets or even black holes. 227.498 - Mosher: SpaceX realized it had to do something, and it did. 229.96 - It created what's called a DarkSat, 232.0 - which is a satellite that has all of its shiny parts 234.52 - coated in a very black, dark material. 238.51 - Narrator: It also tried adding visors 240.13 - to shield those shiny parts from the ground. 242.47 - But unless the satellites are cloaked 243.96 - like a spaceship in \"Star Trek,\" 245.53 - technology that does not exist, 247.52 - none of this will fully solve the problem. 249.63 - And even if it did, there is a much bigger issue at hand. 253.14 - Mosher: There's a concern about space debris, 254.93 - because when you have so many satellites 257.309 - in the closest, tightest, densest orbits around Earth, 260.64 - there's a higher chance that those satellites 262.77 - could collide with each other or with other satellites. 265.715 - Narrator: Those crashes would create 267.192 - clouds of debris that can orbit the Earth 269.37 - for years, decades, or even centuries. 272.76 - Mosher: And that debris can then disable 274.51 - or cause other satellites 275.551 - to crash into each other, creating even more debris, 277.73 - and this problem spirals out of control 279.87 - in an effect called the Kessler syndrome. 281.89 - And if we reach that, 283.017 - then essentially space is too unsafe to access. 286.053 - Narrator: To be clear, the risk 287.228 - of a runaway Kessler syndrome is very low. 289.73 - Mosher: But the potential impacts of that are so high 292.32 - that scientists are working very hard 294.34 - to control such an event from ever happening. 296.74 - Narrator: SpaceX has said its satellites 298.34 - can automatically move out of the way to avoid collisions. 301.3 - But dozens of SpaceX satellites are already disabled 304.33 - and can't move at all, posing a potential threat. 307.28 - And those concerned with SpaceX's plans 309.541 - are lobbying the FCC to rein in the company 311.96 - and more strictly regulate low-Earth orbit. 314.37 - And that could make it more expensive 316.01 - and harder to deploy the planned 42,000 satellites. 319.48 - But it doesn't stop at Starlink. 321.34 - Amazon's Kuiper project, OneWeb, 323.994 - China's Hongyan, and other projects 326.172 - are looking to challenge SpaceX 327.977 - by launching their own global networks 329.75 - of hundreds or thousands of satellites. 332.54 - If they all got their way with little to no regulation, 335.345 - we could end up with 100,000 satellites 337.58 - encasing our planet within the next 10 years, 340.3 - dramatically increasing the risk 342.0 - of blocking off space for everyone."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Starlink: A Satellite Revolution   0:40 - Internet Access Challenges and Satellite Solutions   1:30 - The Vision and Business Case for Starlink   2:10 -

69.66 - - It's fundamentally a diffusion model 72.33 - which is a type of generative model. 74.67 - It creates a more distilled image 77.7 - starting from random noise. 79.56 - - [Joanna] Okay, here are the basics. 81.09 - The AI model analyzed lots of videos 83.79 - and learned to identify objects and actions. 86.73 - When given a text prompt, 88.2 - it creates a scene by defining the timeline 90.78 - and adding detail to each frame. 93.0 - What makes this AI video special compared to others 95.85 - is how smooth and realistic it looks. 98.49 - - If you think about filmmaking, 100.86 - people have to make sure that each frame continues 104.64 - into the next frame with the sense of consistency 108.18 - between objects and people. 110.22 - And that's what gives you a sense of realism 113.07 - and a sense of presence. 114.51 - And if you break that between frames, 116.85 - then you get this disconnected sense 119.46 - and reality is no longer there. 121.65 - And so this is what Sora does really well. 124.26 - - You can see lots of that smoothness 126.06 - in the videos OpenAI generated from the prompts I provided. 129.45 - But you can also see flaws and glitches. 132.18 - A female video producer on a sidewalk in New York City 135.81 - holding a high-end cinema camera. 137.55 - Suddenly, a robot yanks the camera out of her hand. 140.94 - - So in this one, 142.65 - you can see the model doesn't follow 145.17 - the prompt very closely. 147.15 - The robot doesn't quite yank the camera out of her hand, 151.35 - but the person sort of morphs into the robot. 156.39 - Yeah, a lot of imperfections still. 158.88 - - One thing I noticed there too 160.08 - is when the cars are going by, 161.67 - they change colors. 164.4 - - Yeah, so while the model is quite good at continuity, 168.3 - it's not perfect. 169.86 - So you kind of see the yellow cab disappearing 172.56 - from the frame there for a while 174.57 - and then it comes back in a different frame. 176.25 - - Would there be a way after the fact to say, 178.417 - \"Fix the taxi cabs in the back?\" 180.87 - - Yeah, so eventually. 182.34 - That's what we're trying to figure out, 184.53 - how to use this technology as a tool 187.26 - that people can edit and create with. 189.66 - - I wanted to go through one other... 191.79 - What do you think the prompt was? 193.5 - - It looks like the bull in a China shop. 195.54 - Yeah, metaphorically, 197.58 - you'd imagine everything breaking in the scene, right? 201.27 - And you see in some cases that the bull is stomping 205.058 - on things and they're still perfect. 208.32 - They're not breaking. 209.64 - So that's to be expected this early on. 211.8 - And eventually, there's gonna be more steerability 214.41 - and control and more accuracy 216.48 - in reflecting the intent of what you want. 219.03 - - And then there was that video of, well, us. 221.49 - The woman on the left looks like 222.72 - she has maybe like 15 fingers in one of the shots. 226.41 - - [Mira] Hands actually have their own way of motion 229.59 - and it's very difficult to simulate the motion of hands. 233.76 - - In the clip, the mouths move but there's no sound. 236.79 - So is audio something you're working on with Sora? 238.777 - - With Sora specifically, 240.45 - not in this moment. 241.59 - But we will eventually. 243.21 - - [Joanna] Every time I watch a Sora clip, 244.8 - I wonder what videos did this AI model learn from? 248.25 - Did the model see any clips of Ferdinand 250.56 - to know what a bull in a China shop should look like? 253.62 - Was it a fan of SpongeBob? 255.66 - - Wow! 256.86 - You look real good with a mustache, Mr. Crab. 259.26 - - By the way, 260.093 - my prompt for this crab said nothing about a mustache. 263.64 - What data was used to train Sora? 266.52 - - We used publicly available data and licensed data. 271.53 - - So, videos on YouTube. 276.54 - - I'm actually not sure about that. 278.13 - - Okay. 279.06 - Videos from Facebook, Instagram. 284.1 - - You know, if they were publicly available, 288.87 - publicly available to use, 291.84 - there might be the data, 293.88 - but I'm not sure. 295.83 - I'm not confident about it. 297.06 - - What about Shutterstock? 298.29 - I know you guys have a deal with them. 301.677 - - I'm just not gonna go into the details of the data 304.409 - that was used, 306.36 - but it was publicly available or licensed data. 309.18 - - [Joanna] After the interview, 310.2 - Murati confirmed that the licensed data 312.12 - does include content from Shutterstock. 314.31 - Those videos are 720p, 20 seconds long. 317.85 - How long does it take to generate those? 319.86 - - It could take a few minutes 321.51 - depending on the complexity of the prompt. 324.18 - Our goal was to really focus 326.07 - on developing the best capability 329.64 - and now we will start looking into optimizing the technology 333.24 - so people can use it at low cost and make it easy to use. 337.08 - - To create these, 337.913 - you must be using a lot of computing power. 340.26 - Can you give me a sense of how much computing power 342.99 - to create something like that 344.94 - versus a ChatGPT response or a DALL-E image? 349.02 - - ChatGPT and DALL-E are optimized 351.87 - for the public to be using them, 354.6 - whereas Sora is really a research output. 358.35 - It's much, much more expensive. 360.33 - We don't know what it's going to look like exactly 362.37 - when we make it available eventually to the public, 365.73 - but we're trying to make it available 368.64 - at similar cost eventually to what we saw with DALL-E. 373.29 - - You said eventually. 374.55 - When is eventually? 375.63 - - I'm hoping definitely this year, 377.97 - but could be a few months. 379.68 - - There's an election in November. 381.18 - You think before or after that? 382.62 - - You know, that's certainly a consideration 385.11 - dealing with the issues of misinformation 389.07 - and harmful bias. 390.69 - And we will not be releasing anything 392.85 - that we don't feel confident on 395.46 - when it comes to how it might affect global elections 400.77 - or other issues. 403.2 - - Right now Sora is going through red teaming, 405.75 - AKA the process where people test the tool 408.09 - to make sure it's safe, secure, and reliable. 411.15 - The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, biases, 413.88 - and other harmful issues. 415.77 - What are things that just you won't be able 418.08 - to generate with this? 419.31 - - Well, we haven't made those decisions yet, 421.2 - but I think there will be consistency on our platform. 423.69 - So similarly to DALL-E 425.28 - where you can't generate images of public figures, 430.83 - I expect that we'll have a similar policy for Sora. 434.46 - And right now we're in discovery mode 436.5 - and we haven't figured out exactly 439.65 - where all the limitations are 441.93 - and how we'll navigate our way around them. 444.57 - - What about nudity? 445.65 - - I'm not sure. 446.483 - You can imagine that... 448.14 - You know, there are creative settings 450.45 - in which artists might want to have more control over that. 455.58 - And right now, we are working with artists 457.699 - and creators from different fields 460.32 - to figure out exactly what's useful, 462.87 - what level of flexibility should the tool provide. 466.53 - - How do you make sure that people 467.85 - who are testing these products aren't being inundated 472.44 - with illicit or harmful content? 474.87 - - That's certainly difficult. 478.11 - And in the very early stages, 480.66 - it is part of red teaming. 483.45 - Something that you have to take into account 487.02 - and make sure that people are willing and able to do it. 492.21 - When we work with contractors, 494.67 - we go much further into that process, 497.58 - but that is certainly something difficult. 499.62 - - We're laughing at some of these videos right now. 502.41 - But people in the video industry may not be laughing 506.13 - in a few years when this type of technology 508.47 - is impacting their jobs. 510.33 - - You know, the way that I see it is this is a tool 514.02 - for extending creativity 516.42 - and we want people in the film industry, 520.14 - creators everywhere, 521.46 - to be a part of informing how we develop it further 526.08 - and also how we deploy it. 527.79 - And also, you know, what are the economics 529.83 - around using these models 532.68 - when people are contributing data and such. 535.5 - - One thing was clear from all this. 537.6 - This tech is going to quickly get faster, better, 540.69 - and become widely available. 542.4 - How are we going to tell the difference 544.23 - between what is real video and what is AI video? 547.77 - - We're doing research and watermarking the videos, 550.26 - but really figuring out content provenance 553.23 - and how do you trust what is real content 556.32 - versus something that happened in reality 558.72 - versus content created for misinformation. 562.23 - And this is the reason 563.28 - why we're actually not deploying the systems yet 566.07 - because we need to figure out these issues 568.17 - before we can confidently deploy them broadly. 570.96 - - [Joanna] That was reassuring to hear. 572.64 - But there are still big concerns 574.47 - about Silicon Valley's race to create AI tools 577.83 - and its ambition for power and money versus our safety. 581.46 - - It's not really a difficult demand or a difficult balance 586.92 - between profit and safety guardrails. 590.37 - I'd say the hard part is really figuring out 594.09 - the safety questions and the societal questions. 598.65 - That's really what keeps me up at night. 601.47 - - There's this amazement about the product, 603.72 - but then we've also talked about all of these concerns. 608.22 - Is it worth it? 609.24 - - It's definitely worth it. 610.71 - AI tools will extend our creativity and knowledge, 617.04 - collective imagination, 618.6 - ability to do anything. 620.61 - It's going to be extremely hard along the way 622.62 - to figure out the right path to bring AI tools 627.39 - into our day-to-day reality. 629.34 - But I think it's definitely worth trying."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to Sora: OpenAI's Text-to-Video AI   0:45 - How Sora Generates Hyper-Realistic Videos   1:15 - Strengths and Glitches in AI-Generated Videos   2:10 - Behind the Scenes: Training Data for Sora   3:00 - Ethical Challenges: Content and Misinformation   3:50 - Technical Challenges: Computing Power and Optimization   4:30 - Implications for the Creative Industry   5:10 - Trusting AI Video: Watermarking and Provenance   6:00 - Balancing Innovation with Safety and Ethics   6:40 - The Future of AI Video Technology"}]}

That's the window. 83.038 - And on the right side there's nothing there, that's why it's darker. 87.417 - And you'll also notice on my skin, the left side is brighter than the right side. 92.26 - And let's do a side-by-side comparison of the light. 95.419 - As you can see, on the left side, the left side of my face is brighter, and the right side, the light is pretty much evenly distributed on my face. 104.971 - The light is directly in front of me and you can see that in my eyes; the reflection of the window is almost centered. 113.428 - Another tip when you are setting up your shot is light source. 124.764 - And that will help you guys when you're setting up your shot. 126.92 - So in this setup I'm further away from the light source. I am a little darker. 131.271 - And I forgot to close my bedroom door, so there's light coming in, bouncing off my shoulder. 136.607 - And that's another way for you to study and learn. 139.294 - When I look at photographs, I'm looking at the eyes, at the skin to tell me where the light is coming from. 145.62 - And then I would kind of imitate that and teach myself. 149.195 - Artificial continuous lighting. 152.142 - In this case, it's a flourescent light. 154.903 - And I bought these off Amazon, it comes in a set of 2. 2 umbrellas, 2 light stands and 2 heads to hold the light bulb. 162.783 - And this is a typical setup, you don't have to do this--you can move it around to suit your needs. 167.48 - But this is what I do. 168.912 - Again, I have some reflection in my eyes. And I will zoom in so you can get a closer look. 175.328 - Those are the umbrella lights reflecting in my iris. 180.112 - And that's where I would be standing. To film. 186.074 - And then the third setup is the ring light. I use this all the time, it's very easy. 191.454 - However, this third setup is the most expensive out of the three. 195.657 - It's very heavy, very cumbersome. 198.054 - But I like the reflective quality my skin and hair give with such a strong concentrated light source. 205.602 - And because it is so strong, I have to cake on my makeup so I don't look as washed out as I am looking right now. 213.423 - And that's pretty much it. If you have any questions, make sure to read the description box first. 219.113 - And, yeah. Music by our homie, Jay Ellyiot. 223.517 - Here are 3 examples of videos that I use natural, flourescent, and ring light in. 229.034 - So make sure to check those out.

No, we won't call it 2.899 - Pixel Fold this time. 5.0 - This time we'll call it Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. 8.0 - Yes, this was the first fold, now it's Pixel 9 Pro Fold. 12.0 - So the generation is a little different, but today we'll do 13.903 - its unboxing & first impressions. 16.0 - Look at the box, it's completely flat & square. It's a 17.5 - little different. 19.0 - There are a lot of interesting things, friends! 21.0 - This time in the Pixel 9 series, there's the Pixel 9, 9 Pro 24.323 - & 9 Pro XL. 25.0 - We've done a video on the 9 & 9 Pro XL, if you haven't seen 28.105 - it, do watch it. 30.0 - I'm not going to talk about a lot of AI stuff in it. 33.0 - But we're definitely going to talk about what's unique 35.531 - about it. 37.0 - And this phone is totally unique according to me. You'll 39.27 - come to know why. 41.0 - Let's open it & see what's inside this small square box. 45.0 - Yes, this is thin! 48.38 - It comes with all the other folds. 54.289 - There's a USB Type C to Type C cable. 55.289 - Look at this. 57.289 - And then you have a sim card tray & documentation. 61.289 - That's about it! It's not a tray, it's a sim card tool. 64.29 - Let's keep this aside & look at the phone. 68.29 - Alright, let's open it. 70.29 - Look at the camera module. 72.29 - Oh, I didn't want to tear it. 74.29 - Oh, let's remove it like this. 78.29 - Ok, this is wide! 81.29 - It's thin, friends! 82.29 - And, ok. 85.29 - I'm going to show you the folds that are available. 93.18 - This is the Vivo X Fold 3 Pro. 95.18 - This is the most popular Z Fold 6 & OnePlus Open. 101.18 - This isn't a fold, but look at these folds. 104.18 - And you'll know how wide the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is. 109.18 - It's more comparable to OnePlus Open, but it's wider than 112.799 - that. 113.18 - But if I compare it with this, it's at least 20% wider. 119.18 - Look at that! 121.18 - Oh my! 123.18 - That's why I ordered all these phones. 125.18 - I think this is just right, slightly wide. 127.18 - But this is very wide. 129.18 - In hand feel, I'd say it's the most wide of the Z Fold 6. 131.18 - Do let me know if I should compare it with the Z Fold 6. 134.18 - Because that's one of the most popular folds available. 137.18 - So we'll compare it with it. The pricing is also comparable. 140.18 - So do let us know in the COMMENTS section. 141.18 - But overall it's wide, but I'd say it's thin. 145.18 - And in terms of weight, I think it's 245g. 149.18 - 243-244g, let's see. 152.18 - It's 28g! 156.84 - According to the Z Fold 6, it's 241g. 160.84 - So it's heavier than the Z Fold 6. 162.84 - In fact, if I look at the OnePlus Open, it's 241g. 165.84 - So it's the most heaviest of the lot. 168.84 - It's wide & heavy. 169.84 - But it's front display is exactly the same as the Pixel 9's 177.015 - 6.3'' display. 179.84 - It feels like they've made a fold around the display. 183.84 - So that's what I think. 185.84 - But yes, I'd say one thing, if I compare it with the Z Fold 188.694 - 6, 189.84 - it's narrow & wide, so you'll do a lot of things on the 193.825 - front screen. 194.84 - Alright, let's start it. 196.84 - Till then let me quickly show you the ports & buttons. 199.84 - At the bottom, you get a sim card tray, 2 microphones, 203.84 - a speaker grill with a USB Type C port. 206.84 - On the right, there's a volume rocker at the bottom. 208.84 - You'll need some time to get used to it. 210.84 - And then there's a power on off button at the top. 212.84 - Generally, the position of the volume rocker is at the top. 216.84 - Then you have a speaker grill at the top. 218.84 - And what's this? It's a mm wave antenna. 222.84 - And then you get a microphone at the top as well. 226.84 - On the left, you don't have a microphone. 228.84 - Wow! I mean, this feels like Gorilla Glass Victus 2's 231.286 - protection. 232.84 - Before you comment that I forgot to drop it, let's drop it. 235.84 - And let's drop it from the top. 237.84 - It's a Gorilla Glass Victus 2, nothing should happen. 245.31 - In fact, I'll drop it hard. 250.669 - Alright, nothing. 252.669 - Nice! The build is good. It's thin but it feels good. 256.67 - So it stays at most of the angles. 259.67 - Even this angle is nice. 266.48 - Talking about the crease, I think it's an average sized 269.972 - crease. 271.48 - It's not less, not more. I'd say it's an average size. 275.48 - Yeah, that's about it. But the display inside is big. 277.48 - Talking about the upper display, it's a 6.3'' big display 280.913 - with 120Hz but it's FHD+. 283.48 - Talking about the inner display, it's a big 8'' square 287.68 - display with 2K resolution & 120Hz. 290.48 - It has 2700 nits brightness, so it's a very bright display. 295.48 - The outer display is also 2700 nits brightness, so I'd say 298.177 - it's a very bright display. 300.48 - Talking about the refresh rate, it's 120Hz but 1 is to 120. 304.48 - So it's adaptive. The next one is 60Hz or 120Hz. 307.48 - Talking about the specs, if I compare it with the Pixel 311.098 - Fold 1st generation, 313.48 - then it's an upgrade in all aspects. 314.48 - There were a lot of problems in the Pixel Fold 1st 316.899 - generation. 318.48 - If you look at it online, the 1st generation Pixel wasn't 320.822 - all that great. 322.48 - But they solved a lot of the problems. 325.48 - There was a Tensor G2 chipset, now there's a Tensor G4. 328.48 - There's only 1 variant with 16GB RAM & 256GB storage. 332.48 - Now instead of 256GB, they should've given 512GB. 334.48 - I think for Rs 1,73,000, it's priced at Rs 1,72,999 in 340.676 - India. 341.48 - Think about it! And according to that, it should've been 344.146 - 512GB. 345.48 - The storage type is also UFS 3.1. 348.48 - If you look at the rest of the Folds, you get 4.0 in all of 352.11 - them. 353.48 - It's the latest storage type, but this one is 3.1. 356.48 - It's the Pixel's own storage type, so I'm not sure. 358.48 - And it's an LPDDR5X RAM type. 360.48 - Talking about the battery, it's a 4650mAh battery. 363.48 - And it's 21W charging. 365.079 - 21W? I mean, again, not done! 368.48 - Anyways, it's a good thing that the battery will last you 370.73 - for the whole day. 372.48 - We've tested it & you get a good 5.5-6 hours of screen on 376.099 - time. 377.48 - So you should have a normal usage for the whole day. 379.48 - Absolutely, you shouldn't have any problems. 381.48 - And remember, you're only going to use the front screen 385.146 - 70-90% of the time. 387.48 - So that's good. If you use the inner display, the battery 389.491 - will obviously last longer. 391.48 - Now let's talk about performance. 392.48 - Again, if I talk about OnePlus Open, Z Fold 6, Vivo XFold 3 397.089 - Pro, 398.48 - these all give better performance. 401.48 - In comparison to them, the AnTuTu score is 1.2-1.3M. 404.48 - When you shift to TSMC in the next variant, we'll see a 408.939 - score improvement. 411.48 - You'll be able to do 60FPS gaming. 413.48 - But people who are going to buy this phone, will buy it for 416.358 - multitasking & camera. 417.48 - And if I talk about the specs, you get a 48MP primary 422.798 - sensor, 10.5MP ultrawide sensor, 427.11 - and a 10.8MP 5X telephoto sensor. 430.11 - Where did these numbers come from? I really don't 432.519 - understand. 434.11 - But yes, you get a 5X telephoto sensor, so that's good. 437.11 - And if I talk about the inner sensor, it's not in the 438.646 - middle or here. 440.11 - You get the sensor on the extreme right, which is 10MP. 444.11 - And the front sensor is in the middle, in the center punch 446.828 - hole. 448.11 - And that is also 10MP. 450.11 - So there are 5 cameras in total. 452.11 - But how is the performance? I'm going to talk about AI & OS. 456.11 - Wait for that as there are some interesting things. 458.11 - But again, we expect a lot from Pixel. 461.11 - The cameras are good, we've taken different photos in the 463.221 - original quality phase. 465.11 - We'll talk about that in comparison. But right now, let's 466.517 - talk about the cameras. 468.11 - There's a bit of a reddish tint, if you take portraits or 470.36 - normal skin tones. 471.11 - So there are warm tones, I'm not sure why they weren't able 474.481 - to fix it. 476.11 - And even the bokeh I saw in some photos, it looked very 479.443 - unnatural. 481.11 - It was looking a bit too much. 483.11 - And the bokeh doesn't look natural when there's a fall off. 487.11 - When there's less bokeh when it's close, and when it's far, 489.268 - it should look smooth. 491.11 - The fall off didn't look that good or natural to me. 494.11 - And despite being Google's Pixel flagship, the edge cutout 500.475 - leaves a lot to desire. 504.11 - It's still not as good as it should be. 508.11 - And if you don't believe me, you're a Pixel hater, it's not 511.481 - like that. 513.11 - Go & see the photos in the original quality, you'll know 515.411 - what I'm saying. 516.11 - And especially when we compared the photos side by side, 523.11 - we found that it wasn't normal. 526.11 - Even the colours of the t-shirt, where it's blue, looked a 527.636 - bit purple to me. 529.11 - Because there's a bit of a reddish tint added to it. 531.11 - So you know, that is them. 533.11 - But yes, all the features are there. 536.11 - In fact, the AI features in the photos, especially the 539.254 - magic eraser, 541.11 - I think this does it perfectly. 542.11 - It does it perfectly. 544.11 - The better Google Pixel does it, and that's expected, 547.11 - the less time it takes, and it's very nicely implemented. 551.11 - So the AI features in the photo editing, even in the OS, 553.263 - they work quite well. 555.11 - And I won't go into details about the AI features, 558.11 - I've already talked about it in the 9 Pro XL video I'm 560.269 - giving in the iCard. 562.11 - But in the video, it does 4K 60FPS front & back. 566.11 - So yeah, that is there. 568.11 - Let's talk about the OS. 569.11 - Yes, Android 14 is out of the box. 571.11 - Android 15 isn't there, which is what I think it should be. 574.11 - But yes, Android 14 is there, plus 7 years of updates! 576.11 - So you're going to get Android from 2021, if you use 6-7 579.665 - years. 581.11 - So all the sensors are there, connectivity, next level WiFi 584.632 - 7, etc. 586.11 - So you don't have to worry about sensors, connectivity, 588.41 - small features, 590.11 - we don't talk much about them. 592.11 - And Google hasn't mentioned anything about the durability. 595.11 - I'm not interested in how many folds there are, there are 7 596.897 - years of updates, but it should last for 7 years, but they 598.679 - haven't said. 600.0 - But obviously, it must have been tested. 602.0 - If I talk about the small features, then there's IPX8 604.338 - certification. 606.0 - But for multimedia, it's amazing except for 1 caveat. 609.0 - I mean, the audio quality is excellent & the pictures you 612.275 - see are of top notch quality. 615.0 - But yes, due to the square display, when you see 16.9, you 620.139 - get huge black bars. 623.0 - Despite being Google's own phone, Android being Google's & 627.543 - Pixel having Android & Google as the owner, 632.0 - the optimizations of the OS are better than Z Fold 6 & 635.97 - OnePlus Open. 638.0 - For eg, I have to use Instagram, it's not all that well 641.333 - optimized. 643.0 - It's not that you can't use it, obviously you can, but 646.34 - they're not as well optimized as Z Fold 6. 649.0 - Yes, you can do multitasking, you can split windows in 1 653.765 - type, you can use 3 apps in 1 window. 658.0 - So it's a multitasking thing, but the optimization could 660.27 - have been better. 662.0 - And I'm looking at this phone from a Rs 1.73 Lakh 666.164 - smartphone, so how should it be? 670.0 - Because if you look at the rest, you get the rest of the 672.126 - folds for Rs 1.5 Lakh. 674.0 - This is more expensive than that, so you need more things, 675.784 - right? 676.0 - So this is the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold. 681.0 - For which I was impatiently waiting for. 684.0 - And the camera that I thought would be the best camera on 687.402 - the Fold, 689.0 - I think it's not that. 691.0 - It'll probably improve with updates, we'll wait for it. 694.0 - We're going to get major updates for 7 years, so there's a 695.977 - lot of scope for improvement. 698.0 - But if you're a Pixel fan, you'll have mixed reactions like 701.746 - me. 703.0 - Yes, if you have any questions, do ask. 706.0 - As I said, we're bringing a comparison with this one. 709.0 - Because this is the most popular, so I'm going to compare 711.279 - it with this one. 713.0 - And they're very different. 715.0 - Even though they're Android foldable smartphones, but 717.717 - they're quite different. 720.0 - We'll talk about it, but we'll stop for that. 722.0 - That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin 724.401 - & Stay Safe!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold   1:00 - Unboxing and Box Contents   2:00 - Design and Build Quality Overview   3:00 - Display Features and Comparisons   4:00 - Performance and Hardware Specifications   5:00 - Camera Features and AI Capabilities   6:00 - Battery Life and Charging Details   7:00 - Software Updates and Long-term Support   8:00 - Pricing and Value Proposition   10:00 - Final Impressions and Upcoming Comparisons"}]}

Let's keep it aside & look at the phone. 177.219 - Let's look at the phone. 179.219 - Ports & Buttons, Sim card tray at the bottom, Microphone, 181.934 - USB Type C, Speaker grill. 184.219 - On the right, there's a power on & off button. 186.219 - And then you have a volume rocker. 188.219 - On top, there's an IR blaster, speaker grill & a noise 191.025 - cancelling microphone. 193.219 - On the left, there's my beautiful alert slider. 197.219 - Wow, I just love it! 199.219 - And it's very tactile, you can feel it very well. 204.219 - Let's talk about the sim card tray. 208.219 - I don't think it'll be an SD card tray, but let's see. 212.219 - There's a dual nano sim card slot. 214.219 - There's no SD card slot. 217.219 - Oh, there's a scratch guard, so we'll definitely scratch it. 223.18 - Very nice, let's see. 225.18 - The in hand feel is slightly bigger & slightly on the heavier side. 228.18 - I think it'll be around 203-204g. 232.18 - It should be. Let's see. 234.18 - It's 201g, so I was near. 238.18 - Not bad. 240.18 - I don't know about the protection, generally OnePlus phones 241.568 - come with a dragon trail. 243.18 - But OnePlus didn't tell us about the protection. 245.18 - We're going to drop it, whether it's there or not. 248.18 - Let's do this! 1, 2 &... 250.18 - It's metal, so if I drop it from the back, there might be a dent. 257.319 - Let's see. 1, 2 &... 258.319 - There's a problem with metal. 261.319 - When it falls, especially on rocks, you'll have those dents. 265.319 - Which you can't do anything about. 267.319 - There's nothing on it. 269.319 - Absolutely nothing. 271.319 - Let's start! 273.319 - The display is amazing! 275.319 - It's a 6.74'' 120Hz AMOLED display. 279.319 - If you look at the bezels, there aren't any. 282.319 - The chin is absolutely thin. 284.319 - The side bezels are also very thin. 285.319 - The brightness is 2150 nits peak, so it's a bright display as well. 290.319 - Now let's talk about the specifications. 293.319 - It comes on 7 Plus Gen 3 processor. 297.319 - 7 Plus Gen 3 is the name of the 7th generation. 299.319 - But it's AnTuTu score is 1.4-1.45 million. 302.319 - So you get a flagship level performance. 304.319 - And actually, if you work on it, do any task or do gaming, 307.653 - you'll see that performance. 309.319 - I'm going to talk about that. 311.319 - It has the base variant of 8GB RAM & 128GB RAM. 314.319 - It has LPDDR5X RAM type in all variants. 316.319 - But in the base variant, you get UFS 3.1 storage type. 320.319 - If you take the upper variant of 256GB, 12GB, 256GB, etc, 324.319 - you'll get UFS 4.0 storage type. 326.319 - I don't know the price of it when I'm unboxing it. 329.319 - But the Nord C4 is around Rs 25K. 333.319 - The Lite is around Rs 20K. 335.319 - So I'm thinking that the base variant will start at Rs 30K. 336.319 - And the upper variant will be around Rs 35K. 340.319 - I'm not sure. 342.319 - The good thing is that it has a 5500mAh battery which is really good. 346.319 - And OnePlus phones are generally monsters in terms of battery. 349.319 - And this one is obviously no different. 351.319 - It has 100W charging & a 5500mAh battery. 354.319 - You can easily use it for 1.5 days. 356.319 - If I talk about the gaming performance, 358.319 - you can play COD Mobile at 120FPS on the highest setting. 362.319 - In fact, we also played Genshin Impact. 363.319 - We continuously got 55-56FPS frame rate. 367.319 - Which was quite good. 369.319 - There were absolutely no problems in gaming. 371.319 - But I have to say that the haptic feedback is excellent. 376.319 - In fact, I was trying the alert slider. 379.319 - When you do it on silent or vibrate, 381.319 - you get that haptic feedback & it's just so satisfying. 384.319 - Well done! It's one of the best haptic feedbacks on the phone. 387.319 - OnePlus phones are generally good. 389.319 - But this one is no different. 390.319 - OS UI 392.319 - It comes on OxygenOS 14.1 which is based on Android 14. 396.319 - And if I talk about the OS updates, 398.319 - you get 4 years major updates & 6 years security updates 401.267 - for the first time. 403.319 - This is the first time you're getting so many updates on a 404.909 - OnePlus phone. 406.319 - And it's OxygenOS & it's quite fluid. 409.319 - Obviously, ColorOS is the base & OxygenOS's skin is on it. 413.319 - There are 3rd party apps. 415.319 - There are some games & they're small games. 417.319 - I don't know what's the need to put such small games in 418.025 - such a powerful phone. But there are 3rd party apps which you can uninstall. 422.319 - Even OnePlus says that they've given these apps to improve 424.522 - the user experience. 426.319 - But while setting up, we didn't see any dark patterns. 432.15 - Fluency certifications come with OnePlus phones & they give 433.789 - you 4 years. 435.15 - But this time, they've said that you'll get 6 years of fluency updates. 440.15 - Yes, but there's one thing. 442.15 - You'll use it for 6 years & before that, the color 444.049 - shouldn't come in this line. 446.15 - Talking about the sensors, all sensors are present. 448.15 - There's an in-display fingerprint sensor, face unlock & it works quite well. 450.15 - Connectivity, there's Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, all 5G bands are supported. 458.15 - There's NFC support, there's IR blaster too. 461.15 - So connectivity options are all there. 463.15 - Talking about the other features, there's IP65 certification. 467.15 - Like I said earlier, there's an alert slider. 469.15 - Oh my God, that's a plus! 471.15 - There's no notification light, no FM radio, SAR value & 472.722 - within limits. 474.15 - There's a feature of beacon link. 476.15 - You can call on Bluetooth. 477.15 - So these days, Oppo phones have this feature. 481.15 - If you're within 30m, you can call on Bluetooth with beacon link. 486.15 - There's no wireless charging & it's available in Rs 25K. 490.15 - There's a Motorola phone that offers wireless charging in Rs 30K. 494.151 - Multimedia, there's an amazing display. 497.151 - There's no HDR on Netflix, but you'll enjoy watching videos on YouTube. 504.151 - Because the display is really nice & the stereo speakers are good. 508.151 - So overall, the multimedia experience is good. 510.151 - Alright, let's talk about the camera. 512.151 - Performance, display & looks are the highlights. 516.151 - Camera, it might not be. 518.151 - In Rs 30K, it's similar to what you'd expect from a phone. 523.151 - It has a dual camera setup. 525.151 - It has a 50MP Sony 600mm sensor & an 8MP ultrawide camera. 529.151 - It takes decent pictures in normal conditions. 533.151 - You get a 16MP selfie sensor. 536.151 - But if you want to see the photos in the original quality, 539.151 - I'm giving you the G-Drive link. 541.151 - We've taken the photos in different conditions. 544.151 - Go check it out. 546.151 - You can do 4K 60FPS with the rear camera. 549.151 - But yes, you get 4K 60FPS. 552.151 - If I talk about the features, you get all the features in 554.877 - the Oxygen OS camera app. 557.151 - Pro, Video, Photo, Portrait Mode, Time Lapse, Slow Motion, Night Mode, 562.151 - High Resolution, Panoramic Mode, Film Mode, Long Exposure, 566.712 - Dual View Mode & Dock Scanner. 570.151 - I'd say don't buy the base variant as it's UFS 3.1. 573.151 - UFS 4.0 gives a good performance boost. 576.151 - So if you're looking for a 12MP, 256MP or higher resolution 578.385 - camera, If you're buying the OnePlus variant, then the 580.452 - price will go up to Rs 33-34 Lakhs. 582.831 - And in that price range, there are better camera smartphones. 585.831 - Especially, I'm missing the telephoto. 587.831 - If you wanted a 2X telephoto for portraits, it really helps. 592.831 - But it doesn't have it, you get 50MP plus 8MP Ultra Wide. 596.033 - So that is slightly a downside. 598.831 - But overall, it's a OnePlus phone, OnePlus Nord series 601.734 - phone & they're very popular in India. 604.831 - And especially this time, you're getting a metal back with 607.061 - a different design. 607.831 - You can see that OnePlus is working on the design, which is 611.872 - a good thing. 613.831 - Display is amazing, performance is also excellent. 616.831 - There are some highlights & some minor things. 619.831 - This is the OnePlus Nord 4, a mixed bag. 622.831 - Before ending the video, if you enjoyed the video, then do 625.222 - hit LIKE & SHARE it with your friends. 627.831 - To the OnePlus fans, let me tell you that we have a new 630.756 - video every alternate week on Sundays. 632.831 - So if you have any questions regarding the OnePlus Nord 4, 635.151 - then do tell us. 636.831 - And you should do a full review. 638.831 - That's all for this video, until the next one, Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to OnePlus Nord 4   0:21 - Unboxing and Box Contents   1:00 - First Look and Design Features   1:45 - Build Quality and Metal Back Panel   2:20 - Display Specifications and Features   3:00 - Hardware, Performance, and Gaming   3:40 - Battery and Charging Capabilities   4:30 - OS, Updates, and Software Features   5:20 - Camera Overview and Performance   6:00 - Final Impressions and Closing Remarks"}]}

performance Gap the difference between 14.0 - someone who becomes a millionaire and 15.759 - someone who's just getting by lies in 18.08 - their obsession with closing this Gap 20.359 - most people's paths look something like 22.519 - this up and down all over the place and 25.279 - they never reach their end goal a person 27.519 - who becomes a millionaire in their 50s 29.4 - will have a part path a bit more like 31.4 - this eventually getting to their goal 33.8 - now my path was a little bit different 35.879 - now I managed to go from point A to 37.76 - point P pretty quickly to be honest I 40.36 - think the only reason I managed to 42.079 - bridge this Gap was because I didn't 43.879 - have any other options I wasn't 45.879 - particularly talented or smart I didn't 48.199 - have any qualifications to lean on and 50.559 - after getting bullied by my first boss I 52.96 - quit the usual 9 to5 grind so I made a 55.6 - promise to myself to become wealthy as 58.12 - fast as possible I did everything my 60.239 - power to bridge the performance Gap and 62.16 - I became a millionaire in my 65.04 - 20s if you only remember one thing from 67.72 - this video then let it be this the 69.96 - amount of money you make is always 71.92 - directly proportional to the amount of 73.72 - perceived value you give to put it 75.96 - simply the bigger the problems you're 77.96 - able to solve the more money you'll make 80.2 - and the faster you'll Bridge the 82.079 - performance Gap so the first thing I 83.96 - want you to do is draw out a VIN diagram 86.159 - like this in this section I want you to 88.4 - write down the things you like to do do 90.24 - so if I was doing this I'll put down 92.24 - racing cars flying planes traveling and 96.28 - playing golf I'm sure you have a lot of 98.32 - others you can add so just go crazy with 101.0 - it in this next one write down the 102.72 - things you're good at off the top of my 104.68 - head I'd say having conversations 106.96 - building and designing models leading 109.32 - teams and carpentry and finally write 112.04 - down the things that people will pay you 113.68 - a lot for let's put down Consulting 116.28 - building structures and designing 118.52 - complex mechanics the Trap that most 120.759 - people fall into is only considering one 122.799 - of these factors when they're deciding 124.479 - what they want to do with their life I 126.119 - mean imagine choosing a job just because 128.319 - you love it but you're stuck making 130.039 - minimum wage and before you know it 132.16 - you're hating what you once loved talk 135.12 - about a passion killer or picture this 137.56 - you're good at something so you make it 139.44 - your job but you're working your fingers 141.68 - to the Bone and still not making enough 143.56 - money you're stuck in your comfort zone 146.239 - not really going anywhere and then 148.0 - there's this scenario where you pick a 149.519 - job just because it pays well which 152.08 - sounds good right well not if you're 154.319 - miserable every single day that's why 156.519 - the only solution to becoming rich and 158.84 - happy is to find something that's in all 161.56 - sections I call this the value Zone I 165.48 - managed to find this early on by 166.879 - combining my passion for model 168.319 - helicopters with my skill for building 170.44 - models and advice people would pay for 173.08 - this led me to opening multiple model 174.92 - shops and designing my own brand of 176.72 - models that I sold across the globe the 179.239 - problem with the way way most people 180.56 - look at business is they want to find 182.319 - the side hustle or the method first and 184.959 - then try to fit themselves around it 186.959 - rather than nailing down their value 189.04 - Zone and then finding the correct side 191.08 - hustle to start for them so now you know 193.28 - how to find your value Zone it's time to 195.48 - pick the right vehicle to drive you in a 197.68 - straight line to your 199.67 - [Music] 201.56 - destination let me ask you a question 204.04 - would you rather have a million dollar 205.72 - in assets or earn a million dollar per 208.239 - year think about that for a second of 210.76 - course you want both right well to do 212.92 - this you're going to need two different 214.72 - Vehicles one for making money and the 217.879 - other one for investing money let's 220.519 - start with making money this should be 222.519 - your active vehicle think of it like a 225.159 - motorbike you can choose between a 227.08 - product based business like I started a 229.84 - Content business like making YouTube 232.2 - videos and my alltime favorite a 234.799 - service-based business so why is a 237.28 - service-based business my favorite when 240.36 - I produce products and also make YouTube 243.159 - videos might seem a bit strange right 245.72 - one word timing and I'm not talking 248.04 - about time in the market but instead 250.319 - your career timing your initial side 252.879 - hustle should have the potential to rake 254.68 - in about 100K a year but remember the 257.759 - Venture that catapults you to 1 million 259.919 - or even 10 million a year is not going 262.52 - to be the same when you're starting 265.04 - resources are usually pretty tight so 267.479 - it's smarter to launch a service-based 269.32 - business business as it has minimal 271.36 - setup costs even better if you could do 273.88 - it from a laptop in your spare time so 275.96 - take a look at your diagram again and 278.32 - brainstorm a service you can offer 280.68 - within your value zone now for investing 283.44 - money this should be your passive 285.28 - vehicle think of it like the side car on 287.68 - your motorbike you know like the one in 290.0 - Harry Potter loads of people treat inves 292.24 - in like it's just another side hustle 294.52 - chasing it with that same getrich quick 296.919 - mindset but here's the real deal 299.88 - investing isn't about overnight riches 302.88 - it's a tool to grow your wealth and if 305.56 - you do it right you can just set it and 308.199 -

slowing down and losing their focus 502.24 - completely you have three main limited 504.56 - resources money time and energy if you 508.159 - want to do this with me grab a piece of 510.0 - paper and three different colored pens 512.24 - firstly make a list of everything you do 514.44 - in your life this should include 517.039 - everything now draw a graph like this 519.0 - and divide it into segments 520.519 - corresponding to the number of items on 522.36 - your list for my example that would be 524.959 - six segments but for you it could be 527.279 - more or less first use a color to shade 530.2 - in the proportion of money you spend on 532.8 - each segment every month then use a 534.959 - different color to shade in the amount 536.48 - of time you spend on each activity 539.04 - monthly lastly use yet another color to 542.44 - show the amount of energy each task 544.64 - requires you should have something that 546.64 - looks a bit like this here's the key 548.959 - your resources will always be limited 551.6 - while it might be possible to increase 553.2 - the amount of money you have increasing 555.399 - your energy and especially your time 557.68 - just isn't possible when I do this 559.48 - activity with people it's amazing how 561.36 - much they spread their resources to all 563.399 - different areas of their life now I do 565.92 - get work life balance but when you're 568.32 - trying to build your wealth at a quick 570.32 - Pace you really can't spread yourself 572.64 - too thinly when I was building my first 574.72 - business I put my head down and I worked 577.2 - like crazy when I snapped out of it I'd 580.04 - lost a last chunk of my social life I 582.48 - was out of shape and I hadn't spent very 584.68 - much time with my family now was that 586.68 - healthy probably not but did it make me 590.56 - successful very I devoted all of my 593.44 - resources towards a single business for 595.68 - an extended period once I achieved my 598.2 - dream of becoming a milliona in air I 600.04 - began to restore balance to my life 602.68 - however in the early days when I lack 604.88 - money and a team any distraction could 607.56 - have derailed my efforts focus is 609.68 - underrated nowadays I see so many 612.32 - motivated youngsters jumping from side 615.0 - hustle to side hustle falling for 617.279 - something that's known as shiny object 619.76 - syndrome if I constantly switch business 622.0 - model every time something got a little 623.64 - bit difficult then I'd have kept going 625.44 - back to square one and never made any 627.68 - real progression so have a look at your 629.36 - your graph of Truth and ask yourself 631.6 - could you give up any of the things that 633.32 - you're spending time on and allocate 635.519 - your resources elsewhere looking at this 637.88 - example I'll get rid of Tik Tok Xbox and 640.639 - dating straight away now look how much 643.12 - more time money and energy I can 646.32 - allocate to side hustles this will 648.56 - dramatically reduce the time it takes 650.44 - for you to achieve your 653.04 - [Music] 654.399 - dreams there's a great quote by Jim Ron 657.2 - that goes like this if you really want 659.399 - to do something you'll find a way if you 662.079 - don't you find an excuse so if you want 665.16 - to close the performance Gap then you 667.0 - need to understand the difference 668.279 - between obstacles and excuses this is 671.279 - you and these are your dreams between 673.92 - you and your dreams are obstacles and 676.36 - these are what you need to overcome to 678.399 - make your dreams into reality looking 680.88 - back on my younger years boy did I have 683.0 - it rough I was dyslexic and my teachers 686.079 - would often label me as lazy and stupid 688.76 - I left with no qualifications to fall 691.32 - back on and when I finally entered the 693.279 - workforce I was bullied by my manager 695.88 - these were the huge obstructions between 698.32 - me and my dreams but I never allowed 701.56 - them to be my excuses you may also be 704.079 - facing huge obstacles in your life but 706.44 - you must make it your mission to 708.12 - overcome them in order to achieve your 710.76 - dreams because if you don't then those 712.839 - obstacles become the excuses that block 714.92 - the path to your dreams and then you're 717.16 - just left staring at your biggest excuse 719.2 - exuses with your dreams just out of 721.76 - sight excuses not obstacles are the 724.8 - single biggest reason for people never 727.24 - closing the performance Gap whenever 729.2 - someone says to me I can't do something 731.959 - I say this I know you can't right now 735.12 - but if you could what would you do if 737.68 - you're ever facing an obstacle that 739.399 - seems impossible to overcome try and ask 742.199 - yourself the same question come up with 744.92 - lots of different solutions and write 747.16 - them all down the next step is to try 749.48 - those Solutions you might find that many 751.72 - of them don't work but persist and you 754.36 - will eventually 756.08 - [Music] 774.199 - succeed if you've been watching my 776.199 - channel for a while then you've probably 777.8 - heard me say that you're net worth goes 780.32 - crazy after 100K and the biggest reason 783.36 - for this is The Compound Effect it's 785.92 - rumored that Albert Einstein even said 788.68 - compound interest is the eighth wonder 791.0 - of the world he who understands it earns 794.16 - it he who doesn't pays it I've shown in 797.04 - the past how true this is for investing 799.079 - money but this is even more important 801.36 - when it comes to your knowledge bank 803.279 - account most people fail to bridge the 805.24 - last section of the performance Gap 807.16 - because when they leave school they stop 809.12 - St learning let me show you why this is 811.0 - a huge mistake these initial blocks 813.48 - symbolize the basic concepts and 815.68 - principles you learned at school for me 818.44 - that was the basics of English and maths 820.76 - continuing to place yourself in 822.36 - challenging situations enables you to 824.88 - keep learning and growing after school I 828.0 - began working as a carpenter's 829.56 - apprentice and also had multiple side 832.04 - hustles this experience taught me 834.12 - practical skills on how to persuade 836.16 - others to pay for my services as you 838.36 - expand your know know you'll start to 840.16 - notice patterns that were previously 842.519 - invisible each new piece of information 844.92 - builds upon the last if you never stop 847.079 - learning you accumulate a wealth of 849.12 - knowledge by the time you reach my age 851.279 - this is why wisdom can only be acquired 853.32 - through time and experience now every 856.0 - decision I make is supported by Decades 858.44 - of learning if you never had the 861.519 - foundations then you can't start the 863.759 - compounding knowledge magic then you'll 865.639 - end up with huge gaps in your knowledge 867.68 - which will eventually lead you to to 870.519 - crashing and burning closing this 872.839 - performance Gap is going to be painful 874.839 - but remember this if you aren't willing 876.759 - to make sacrifices for your dream then 879.759 - your dream becomes the sacrifice if you 882.12 - want to understand the compounding 883.68 - effect even more then you should watch 885.72 - this video next where I explain how net 888.079 - worth goes crazy after 100K but don't 891.12 - click on it just yet make sure to 893.079 -

- We completed the shot on iPhone challenge 2.51 - over two years ago. 4.4 - That's right, our Amazon Go Store video was shot 7.31 - almost entirely on iPhone. 10.05 - And none of you noticed until we pointed it out. 12.76 - Now you can accuse the Apple Evangelist of going 15.79 - out of their way to do stuff like that, 17.79 - to paint Apple in a favorable light. 20.0 - As for us, we only did it because of the 22.56 - store policy forbidding real cameras. 25.27 - Which makes the motivation behind today's challenge 27.97 - all the more confusing. 30.41 - - Yeah, why am I, what is this, what am I doing? 32.97 - - Riley is going to be using our iPad Pro to edit a video. 37.36 - This video, in 4K off a Windows based file server. 42.11 - It sounds so wrong. 43.68 - - But it kinda feels right. 46.899 - - Right this same way to our sponsor Thermal Grizzly. 49.47 - Thermal grizzly's conduct out a liquid metal 51.35 - thermal interface material out for its 52.65 - maximum cooling performance for your PC. 55.1 - Check it out in Keep Your PC Cool at the link below. 58.266 - (upbeat music) 67.64 - The idea for this video really came out of our experience 70.71 - reviewing the magic keyboard for the iPad Pro. 73.67 - In that video we concluded that the iPad Pro is now 77.14 - in every sense of the word, a laptop computer 80.19 - And that now the discussion is really more about 82.97 - how to do computer type things, on the iPad Pro. 87.18 - So, Riley replaced his work laptop with iPad Pro for a week. 93.47 - Unbreathed an external monitor and mouse, 95.31 - he did research, entered emails and worked for on files 98.57 - on our company server while editing thumbnails and videos. 102.29 - And as a notorious lunch break gamer, 104.74 - he even managed to sneak a little bit of entertainment 107.77 - and on the side with an Xbox controller. 109.79 - And why not? 110.623 - Since the iPad Pro's processor is more powerful 113.52 - than a Xbox one anyway. 114.96 - First off, the external monitor situation. 117.82 - iPad Pros have supported external displays 120.33 - since the 2018 model arrived with the USB type C port. 123.92 - But despite the massive progress made elsewhere 126.75 - in transforming the iPad Pro into more of a computer, 129.98 - surprisingly little has changed in the display department. 133.44 - 99% of the time, a connected monitor will simply 136.67 - mirror the iPad screen with its frustrating 139.68 - 10 by 7 aspect ratio in all. 142.87 - - Yeah. 145.82 - The other 1% of the time you'll be able 147.86 - to expand the playback window in video editing apps, 151.65 - or play a game in full screen. 153.79 - But you're still not able to simply use a monitor 156.47 - as extra real estate to do with as you please 159.24 - like you can on a PC, or a Mac. 161.76 - We couldn't even find a simple list of iPad apps 164.52 - with external display support. 166.48 - We did find an app called Shiftscreen that 169.77 - lets you fill up the entire display but 172.29 - it's only compatible with a handful of apps. 174.72 - It forces you to use its weird build-in wed browser 177.63 - and it does something nasty to your refresh rate. 180.89 - So, it had us regretting the 14 Canadian dollars 184.01 - we spent on it but there could have been 185.83 - a big old box of 10 bytes buddy and it's no joke either. 190.27 - - Connecting a display requires some sort of dongle 193.51 - or if your monitor has a USB-C video input, 196.41 - you can connect your iPad Pro directly. 198.73 - We ended up using this LG monitor. 201.21 - It has a USB-C connector that serves as a video input 204.23 - and the hub for the two USB 3 pots 206.55 - that are built into the back, 207.77 - which we were able to connect our accessories 209.99 - like an ethernet adapter or external hard drive. 213.34 - What you cannot use 214.69 - is a Thunderbolt three USB-C display or hub. 218.58 - We tried a couple of models that we have 220.27 - here in the office and none of them worked 222.01 - because the iPad does not support Thunderbolt. 224.8 - So if you setting up your own iPad work station at home, 227.76 - you wanna stay away from Thunderbolts, 229.82 - just like real in life. 231.52 - Whatever set up you use, once you get used 233.52 - to the pillow boxing, the iPad Pro as a 235.74 - desktop computer is, surprisingly great. 239.77 - Chrome still needs you to specifically request 242.31 - the desktop version of a website everytime 244.45 - but both safari and Firefox can be setup to 247.55 - fetch desktop versions of great websites like 250.02 - LTTStore.com by default, awesome. 253.75 - Come to of think of it though actually, 255.07 - most of google's apps still kinda suck on the iPad. 258.14 - Particularly gmail and docs, 260.32 - I guess they just prefer you get a Chromebook. 262.62 - Good luck with that. 263.88 - Otherwise the experience of full on desktop browsing 267.03 - on the iPad Pro, with a mouse and keyboard is pretty smooth. 271.55 - Most of the time, I mean Riley did have to take 273.52 - the LTT logo out of his email signature 275.52 - because it was causing the gmail website to crush in safari, 279.56 - but other than that after getting used to some 281.64 - iPad specific gestures kind of like a 284.51 - Chromebook actually, if most of what you 286.67 - do is in a browser, you might even forget at times 289.32 - that you're using and iPad Pro. 292.05 - And this next bit is actually how you know 293.81 - the iPad Pro is a computer now. 295.58 - It breaks Youtube Premium, so if you use the YouTube app 299.11 - a video will stop playing when you go to the home screen. 301.68 - Sometimes you'll even see a pop-up asking if you'd like 304.09 - videos to keep playing when you close the app 305.78 - because boom you could do that with YouTube premium. 308.39 - Ha ha, I guess YouTube doesn't know that safari 312.69 - and Firefox will both keep playing YouTube audio 315.1 - when you switch to other tabs unlike the YouTube app. 318.01 - And it even works when you lock the screen 320.03 - and close the folio. 321.29 - You can just listen to music on your 322.42 - blue tooth headphones with out YouTube premium. 324.9 - If that's not proof that the iPad Pro is a computer 327.7 - I don't know what is. 329.19 - The biggest weakness of the iPad Pro as a desktop 331.93 - however, is the RAM. 334.41 - A bigger display and better input devices 337.18 - make it very tempting to push its multitasking 340.4 - boundaries a little harder than you normally would. 342.65 - And more than three or four apps of safari tabs 345.69 - cause them to reload quite frequently. 347.91 - Now while the standard six gigs of RAM 349.8 - found on all the 2020 iPad Pro models was an upgrade. 353.73 - The problem is it's simply not enough for professionals 356.45 - who are constantly jumping between multiple apps. 360.77 - - Yap. 364.08 - Next step in our work station tests is file management. 367.97 - iOS 13 brought the ability to connect to servers 370.77 - with SMB and we were able to connect to our 373.05 - in-office servers no problem but the files app 376.57 - is still far from perfect. 378.71 - Every time we'd reconnected to the network 380.43 - the files app wouldn't show anything in the server 383.45 - until we ejected then re-established then SMB link. 387.7 - And sometimes transferring a folder would elicit 390.09 - the drag and drop sound but the files wouldn't 393.21 - actually appear in the new location 394.94 - until we happen to check on it later. 396.97 - Video playback chugged a bit even on a 1080p MP4 file, 399.93 - and we know it's not because of our network. 403.34 - Our network's good baby, trust me. 406.1 - There's a few things like that, that make it clear 408.17 - that the files app still has a ways to go 410.35 - in matching once available on Windows and macOS. 413.54 - It was fantastic when Apple added support 415.93 - from multiple windows, and dragging and dropping 418.48 - files to external drives but the lack of basic 421.68 - things like a progress bar, so you can check 424.21 - the status of a file transfer while in another app, 427.04 - really makes you start asking questions like 429.57 - OMG I am using a tablet as a computer? 433.99 - What am I, stupid? 436.31 - What? 439.8 - No! 441.6 - - Until you start using some of the apps that 443.58 - you would think of using a tablet for like 446.51 - for drawing and photo editing. 448.73 - Photoshop has come a long way from its early days 451.99 - on an iPad, when it sort of existed as like three 455.17 - or four different iPad apps, like at least it's 458.01 - just photoshop for iPad now. 460.35 - But unfortunately, it's still missing really 462.86 - basic functionality, like adding drop shadows. 465.73 - Fortunately, apps like Affinity Photo exist. 468.32 - Which have all the features of the vast majority 470.65 - of people using photoshop and all for 472.59 - a one time purchase instead of a subscription. 475.43 - As for video editing, if you're a video professional 478.07 - who's used to programs like Adobe Premiere and Final Cut. 481.35 - LumaFusion is actually pretty impressive 484.52 - in the amount of features that it packs in. 486.74 - There is definitely a learning curve as there is 488.86 - for every editing program. 490.3 - But the basics are surprisingly intuitive 492.81 - and there is way more depth than you would expect 494.99 - in a mobile editing app. 497.02 - We're talking multiple video and audio tracks, 499.72 - reverse color grading with light support 501.94 - excellent speed ramping, video and audio key framing 504.75 - and it was actually like really easy to pull footage 507.27 - off of our server. 508.44 - Even if the playback did suck, just like in the files app. 512.03 - Now someone like Tyren, our very own Tyren, 514.97 - might turn his nose up at the very thought 516.76 - of editing on an iPad, but for the average one man 520.09 - band doing simple video editing, 522.03 - LumaFusion is kinda fantastic. 524.28 - Unfortunately, while these creative type apps are 527.21 - feature rich and run smoothly on the iPad Pro, 530.44 - they're really not optimized for use with a mouse. 533.7 - And so again they kinda, break the illusion that 536.11 - the iPad Pro is just a more different type of Mac. 539.84 - Because it's not a Mac, it's an iPad Pro 542.72 - and apps that take advantage of that like the 544.83 - excellent drawing app Procreate make the iPad Pro 547.85 - a joy to use for designers, artists, basically 551.68 - anyone for whom the Apple Pencil would be a help 554.29 - rather than an hindrance. 555.69 - But what about us, will Riley be switching to an iPad Pro 558.812 - as his daily driver? 560.33 - Riley, we all see you there. 561.73 - Are you gonna switch? 562.563 - - Oh, ah. 568.35 - I won't, but the fact that even think 570.626 - about that question is impressive. 575.02 - During my testing for this script, I wrote down 577.14 - that it was surprisingly hard to be objective about 580.04 - comparisons between the iPad Pro and a real laptop. 583.93 - Because it actually feels really good to just 587.19 - navigate around the iPad OS with the track pad. 589.81 - And that's dumb but it's also really important. 594.74 - The user experience here is polished. 597.35 - It's Apple at their best and going through the process 600.28 - of setting up my iPad Pro work flow, actually made me 602.89 - appreciate why people who daily drive the iPad 605.758 - put up with its weaknesses. 608.23 - The more stuff that I discovered, 609.62 - I could actually do with this thing. 611.78 - The more fun I was having learning about it. 615.53 - It makes sense, I mean if the iPad Pro sucked that much 618.42 - as a computer, then there wouldn't be this whole 621.05 - genre of YouTube videos made by people 623.41 - who love their iPad as a computer. 626.11 - Anyway, I haven't joined the ranks just yet 629.06 - but when I switch back to my Windows laptop, 631.59 - apart of me is going to miss the iPad Pro. 635.29 - Goodnight sweet prince. 636.55 - No, no it's too soon. 638.21 - Am not, am not ready. 642.199 - (sighing) 647.86 - - Hopefully Apple and the passionate developers 650.36 - writing third party apps for the iPad 652.47 - continue to make this thing better. 654.65 - Because as much as gives weird feeling to say it out loud, 658.08 - I'm actually, I don't know, 660.08 - it's hard to use the word excited, 662.86 - but I'm definitely open minded. 665.09 - - [Riley] Ah common Linus. 668.21 - - Baby steps, okay? 669.27 - I'm open minded. 670.725 - (laughing) 671.83 - Little babies, like slowly stepping toward this message 675.91 - from our sponsor. 678.1 - What's in your online security tool kit? 680.43 - Adding a VPN let's you mask your IP 682.44 - and encrypt traffic to and from your devices. 685.21 - Be they desktops, laptops or laptops. 690.24 - And Private Internet Access has reliable servers 692.46 - with over 30,000 servers in more than 30 countries. 695.21 -

why do you fall in love with one person 301.28 - rather than another there's all kinds of 302.96 - cultural reasons that we tend to fall in 304.96 - love when the timing is right we tend to 306.639 - fall in love with somebody who's around 307.84 - proximity is important we tend to fall 309.84 - in love with somebody from the same 311.039 - ethnic and socioeconomic background 313.199 - somebody of the same level of education 315.44 - and there's four basic brain systems 317.84 - that each one of them is associated with 320.0 - a constellation a suite a group of 322.639 - personality traits dopamine serotonin 325.039 - testosterone and estrogen systems i 327.52 - created a questionnaire to see to what 329.68 - degree you express the traits in all 332.8 - four of these basic brain systems it's 334.88 - now been taken by over 15 million people 336.88 - in 40 countries and i'm able to watch 338.96 - who's naturally drawn to whom if you're 341.44 - very high on the traits in the dopamine 343.28 - system risk taking novelty seeking 346.24 - curious creative you tend to be drawn to 349.039 - people like yourself if you are very 351.12 - high on the traits of the serotonin 352.72 - system you tend to be traditional 354.72 - conventional follow the rules respect 356.96 - authority detail-oriented rather than 359.36 - theoretical you're also drawn to people 361.68 - like yourself so if you're very high 363.36 - testosterone you tend to be analytical 365.919 - logical direct decisive good at things 368.96 - like math engineering computers music 371.199 - music is very structural and you're 372.639 - drawn to your opposite high estrogen 374.479 - people and this is men as well as women 376.08 - many more women in that category they 377.84 - tend to see the big picture they think 379.52 - long term 380.4 - they're very imaginative very good at 382.24 - reading posture gesture tone of voice we 384.479 - all express all four systems this is 386.56 - what the problem is with most 387.919 - personality questionnaires today they 389.44 - put you in one bucket or another we 391.44 - express all four brain systems and the 394.0 - traits in each but we express some more 396.56 - than others now there's all kinds of 398.4 - circumstances where people are drawn to 400.24 - their opposite in ways because they had 401.919 - a bad love affair they've been running 403.84 - around all their lives and now they want 405.44 - something more stable so they go for the 407.199 - traditional even if they're very 408.479 - risk-taking this human variety but the 410.4 - bottom line is there's patterns to 411.84 - culture there's patterns to nature and 414.319 - there's patterns to personality this is 416.56 - from sad short friend to how does 419.44 - someone know if they're feeling romantic 421.12 - or platonic attraction there's a literal 424.0 - list of traits that are associated with 426.0 - feelings of romantic love and they are 427.84 - not associated with platonic attraction 430.56 - the first thing that happens when you 431.759 - fall in love is somebody takes on 433.28 - special meaning everything about them 434.96 - becomes special the car they drive looks 438.0 - different from every other car in the 439.199 - parking lot the house that they live in 441.199 - the street that they live on the music 442.72 - that they like when it's a plutonic 444.319 - attraction not everything is special 446.08 - about this human being you like them i 448.319 - mean you're attracted to them you find 449.68 - them amusing or funny or interested but 451.759 - you don't they don't you don't you're 453.36 - not obsessed with them but if you had to 454.96 - think about one just one trait that is 457.36 - most distinctive between the two when 459.44 - you're madly in love with somebody in a 461.12 - romantic attraction you are obsessed and 463.599 - in a plutonic attraction you don't think 465.68 - about them night and day this person is 467.36 - reprogrammed coach is online dating 470.479 - killing romance it can't 472.8 - kill romance this is a basic brain 475.199 - system it evolved millions of years ago 477.28 - it's like hunger or thirst or anger or 481.28 - fear you can't kill romance my next up 484.639 - is from needa beater i wonder what's 486.72 - actually going on through our bodies 488.879 - when we think we're in love like what 491.12 - chemicals are enhanced i and my 493.199 - colleagues have put over 100 people into 495.28 - a brain scanner who were madly in love 497.44 - the first group were people who were 499.199 - happily in love the second were a group 500.96 - of people who were rejected in love and 502.879 - the third was a group of people who were 504.639 - in love long term so we put these people 506.879 - in the brain scanner we had them look at 508.56 - a photograph of their sweetheart and 510.0 - also a neutral photograph so we could 511.68 - compare the brain under both 513.12 - circumstances and we were able to find 515.599 - that everybody who's madly loved 517.279 - rejected in love or in love long term 519.44 - begins to have activity in a tiny little 522.32 - factory near the base of the brain 524.32 - called the ventral take metal area it's 526.16 - way at the base of the brain and that 528.56 - brain region actually makes dopamine and 531.12 - sends dopamine to many brain regions 533.279 - giving you that focus the motivation the 536.16 - obsession the craving of intense 538.88 - romantic love and what's interesting to 540.64 - me is that little factoring the vta lies 543.36 - right next to the factory that 544.8 - orchestrates thirst and hunger thirst 547.279 - and hunger keep you alive today romantic 549.279 - love enables you to focus your mating 551.519 - energy on just one individual at a time 553.839 - and start the mating process and send 555.92 - your dna into tomorrow this is from 558.48 - catch my fly do you believe in soul 560.88 - mates if so do you believe you can have 563.92 - more than one yes and yes i do believe 567.44 - in soul mates i do not believe you can 569.279 - have more than one at a time so now what 571.36 - does a soul mate i think what this 573.279 - person is means is somebody who it's a 576.32 - true love you're not going to sleep with 578.0 - other people you're not thinking of 579.76 - going anywhere you might even consider 582.0 - dying for him or her it is a very deep 585.76 - genuine attachment 587.839 - intense feeling of romantic love and i 590.48 - think that um this is summed up best by 592.8 - a poet from the 15th century in india 595.92 - named kabir the lane of love is narrow 599.44 - there's room for only one and indeed 601.6 - when you're madly in love it's with only 604.16 - one person i do believe you can have a 606.0 - soul mate i think that you may have a 607.839 - series of soul mates but i don't think 610.399 - you can have more than one soul mate at 612.72 - a time from somebody called dance with 614.959 - voices why do people associate love with 617.36 - the heart why not the penis or the 619.6 - sternum there may be a physiological 621.519 - reason why it has been associated with 623.6 - love and that is there's a lot of 625.12 - characteristics a lot of things happen 626.48 - when you fall madly in love and one of 628.0 - them is the heart can really pound when 630.56 - you're really nervous about something i 632.32 - mean when you're madly in love not only 633.92 - do you feel that ecstasy euphoria 635.92 - sleeplessness loss of appetite obsessive 638.16 - thinking about the person craving for 640.24 - emotional union but also all kinds of 642.399 - physiological responses weakness maybe a 644.959 - pounding heart it really started in the 647.839 - 1300s with jotto in a painting prior to 650.48 - that there were a lot of uses of the 652.0 - shape of the heart in fact as early as 654.0 - 5000 years ago in the indus valley they 656.399 - were drawing things that looked like the 658.32 - shape of a heart and at that point it 660.48 - was the seed of a form of parsley plant 664.16 - or a an ivy leaf but it became became 667.12 - associated with romantic love probably 669.12 - with the painting by jotto in in 1309. 672.32 - this is from jay at 53k1 675.839 - i lust hard and lose interest quick 679.279 - how does that work well they're not 681.839 - ready to fall in love we've evolved 683.36 - three distinctly different brain systems 685.36 - from mating and reproduction one is a 687.12 - sex drive linked with testosterone in 689.76 - both men and women the second is 691.12 - romantic love we've been able to prove 692.72 - this is linked with the dopamine system 694.399 - in both men and women that's what gives 696.079 - you the focus the motivation the 697.76 - obsession and the third brain system is 699.76 - attachment that sense of calm and 701.6 - security you can feel with a long-term 703.44 - partner and this individual he's in the 705.519 - lust stage he's not ready to fall in 707.6 - love you know you have to be ready to 709.44 - fall in love to actually do it and he's 712.079 - just experiencing a different brain 714.48 - system the lust system this question is 716.639 - from gertig it's a very interesting 718.639 - question any good data out there on 720.639 - divorce rates for couples that meet via 723.44 - online dating sites apparently if you 727.12 -

What is the truth behind them? 28.08 - Today, I'd like to tell you all about it 30.56 - Shall we begin? 31.58 - First of all, this background should be removed because in reality, the background looks like this 35.4 - A green sheet hangs here 38.54 - Before this, I used to make use of a green screen 42.0 - Let me take you on a tour of my equipment 45.58 - This is my studio set up these days 48.2 - There are two lights hanging, one green sheet that hands as well. And there's a third light down there 52.18 - And this is the camera 54.1 - I've even bought a teleprompter now 56.48 - You could ask me why I bought that 57.94 - The Netflix series that I have been filming- Decode with Dhruv Rathee- You can check it out if you haven't 63.0 - For this series, I was told by Netflix that the setup of my old studio was not sufficient and that the lighting wasn't great 69.06 - So, they told me to upgrade my setup so that they could make videos in collaboration with me 73.02 - Earlier, I used to make use of this 75.28 - You might recall, there used to be a table here 77.34 - and I used to sit and make videos 79.2 - If you compare with the videos today, the lighting in those videos were not that great 81.7 - But the set up is extremely good now, as you can see, but, 85.98 - you don't need such a huge and upgraded setup to start your Youtube career 90.96 - I started mine with merely a mobile phone 94.2 - In this video, I will tell you all that you can achieve on Youtube, with a mobile phone and without spending any money 101.04 - This awesome teleprompter that I have bought is actually Made In India 105.16 - Most of the videos that I have watched on how to start a Youtube channel- talk about technical things 109.78 - For instance, how to make an account on Google etc etc. But, 113.34 - But I'd like to tell you in detail that if you really want to make YouTube videos and want to pursue it as a career, 120.74 - then how can you do that? 122.48 - Let us look at things point by point 124.3 - The first thing is- recording (how to film yourself) 128.0 - Pick up your phone and open the selfie camera 130.7 - That is how easy it is to make videos 132.26 - But it is better to make use of the back camera of your phones, because in most of the phones, 137.18 - the back cameras are of a higher resolution as compared to front cameras 140.7 - If you do not have studio lights, then you can make use of the natural lights- the sunlight- to make videos 145.82 - Notice where the sunlight is coming from, right now 147.52 - It is coming from  this side and the video doesn't look good 149.66 - If I stand this way, then the light comes from behind and this doesn't look great either 152.54 - It looks the best when the sunlight comes from the front 155.2 - Look at how my face is glowing! 157.2 - because the sunlight is coming from the front and hitting my face directly 160.36 - So, stand infront of the window and make videos for the best lighting 164.26 - It is very important for a YouTuber to look into the camera and talk 167.48 - This is a skill that you should have and this is not something that I knew right from my childhood 173.12 - This is not my natural talent 174.8 - I learnt this with trial and error over time and it requires some practice 179.48 - because it is not that easy to talk to objects 182.36 - There is no one in the room and I'm talking as if I am speaking to a human 186.82 - To practice, initially I adopted the idea of taking any object- say this airpod- 193.32 - I will keep this here and imagine it to be a person 196.42 - and just like you tell stories and talk to a person, 201.66 - I will speak to these airpods the same way 203.76 - Tell these airpods all that you did today 206.42 - This is how you can practice talking in front of the camera 211.1 - because the camera is an object too 213.08 - and what you need to do basically is tell stories to the object 215.08 - Let us talk about sound now 216.6 - This microphone that I have bought is worth 5-6 thousand rupees 220.04 - I make my spotify podcasts with this microphone, which is even more professional 225.22 - But honestly speaking, if the environmental conditions are conducive in a room, then you will not need to buy a microphone 231.44 - The microphone of the camera would be sufficient 233.42 - If the voice in your room does not echo 237.28 - The voice in my room echoes a lot 239.56 - since there are not a lot of things here and the room is relatively empty 242.16 - The more things you have in the room, the less it will echo 244.72 - And so I have placed these cushions here- it reduces the echo 247.56 - and have bought these sheets to reduce the echo too 251.52 - You can make use of sheets and towels- all of them reduce echoes 256.06 - The more your room is filled, the lesser you would need to buy a microphone 261.38 - and the sound quality would improve proportionately 263.5 - This is the heavy weight camera that I am making use of these days 266.3 - But honestly speaking, it is only as effective as an iPhone if the lighting conditions are sufficient 272.7 - So, you can make use of whatever phones you have to make videos 277.38 - These days, almost all phones have HD recording 280.9 - But more important that these technical things is- before making any video, 285.32 - you need to have a rough script 287.32 - on what you are going to say in the video. Have you researched on it? 290.84 - There are some exceptions to this though- for example, you do not need a script while vlogging 295.16 - But most of the videos that are made on Youtube, require a script 301.34 - including comedy videos 302.88 - Bhuvan Bam works on the scripts of his videos for weeks! 307.78 - Almost all the topics require scripting 310.78 - My scripts look somewhat like this- the script is of 10-12 pages. There are bullet points and paragraphs 317.32 - There are sources beneath every sub topic 320.08 - and you can see that everything is not written line by line 322.78 - Things are explained here. I read them, understand them and then make you understand them 328.38 - and this is why it takes me 3-4 hours to make a 10 minute video 332.54 - because I keep repeating the lines until I am satisfied that I have delivered them perfectly 338.76 - and that the lines convey exactly what I want to say in a summarized manner 344.48 - And this is why I's like to say that when you make your own Youtube videos, 348.38 - there is no reason to get flustered if you stumble or say something wrong 353.54 - You can take a re take 354.74 - Let the camera run- That is what I do. The recording goes on and I keep on speaking 359.54 - until I am satisfied that I delivered the lines perfectly 361.88 - After that, I cut out that part that I don't want and keep the part that I am satisfied with during editing 368.04 - Editing is one of the most important aspects for a Youtuber 372.8 - If the editing is good, the video will do great 374.98 - and if the editing is sub par, then even a good content can perform not so well 379.24 - You will get access to several free video editing apps on App store and Google Play store 383.66 - But one of the best apps for free video editing, according to me is Vita App 388.58 - Let me give you a few editing tips, using this app 391.6 - It is very simple to use. For example, let me take this Switzerland clip 395.78 - First, choose the clip 396.94 - Here is the editing option. Now, for the part I want to remove, I press edit 401.66 - split it 402.86 - and I can cut this part out very easily 406.1 - A music would be nice for his clip. So, I'd add some music 409.52 - Let's see how it looks (and sounds) 413.06 - I'll use this one 414.52 - If I want the beat to overlap, I can move the sound clip around and place it 420.28 - These sound waves tell you that the music here is changing slightly 430.86 - Say I want to add the fire emoji 432.86 - You can resize it and decide where to place it in the video 435.86 - You can simply place this fire emoji at the desired place. The editing is as easy as that 439.4 - and you can change the duration for which the fire emoji appears from here 442.88 - This is how memes, photos and any other icon can be added 446.58 - If I want to add any text , write something 449.58 - and I can join many clips together in this app 453.92 - I can add music or effects 456.34 - Let me give you an example 457.96 - A clip that I have shot for this video itself 464.02 - \"And editing is one of the most important... \" 465.34 - You'll notice that I started to speak a little late, so there is no need for the part at the beginning 469.48 - I normally cut out such parts 471.3 - You can see that I reduce this part and so the video starts from here 475.86 - I extend the music to this clip as well 479.24 - You can even add transitions in between to make the video look nicer 483.32 - For this, click on the transition icon 485.54 - and choose the kind of transition you want- the dissolve effect... Since, I like the black screen, I choose that one 491.56 - and behold- there is a transition in the video 493.56 - If you feel that the video is slightly slow, you can increase its speed 498.04 - And now, the video is a little sped up 504.22 - You might have noticed that I zoom in on my videos in my vlogs sometimes 507.14 - This is very easy to do as well. You can simply select the effects option- and there is the zoom in effect 510.78 - I really like this effect 517.88 - You can change the ratio here- a 16:9 ratio is used for shooting videos for Youtube 522.68 - But for Instagram, the ratio is 1:1 525.46 - You can easily change this on this app 527.72 - This is something that is difficult to do in most video editing apps 531.88 - Here, the watermark of the app is displayed. In most of the free video editing apps, there will be a water mark but, 537.62 - this watermark can be removed in this app 540.3 - Toggle the watermark switch off in the settings 544.16 - As for the resolution, the highest one is the best . 1080p is full HD 548.9 - and 720p is HD 550.62 - There are very few free video editing apps which have no useless ads and do not force insert their water marks either 556.88 - I found this to be one of the best apps for free video editing 559.76 - I will provide its link in the description below 562.18 - If you want to use it, you can check it out 565.12 - Editing is something that you will learn only through practice 567.38 - Experiment with it- where you should put some music and where you should cut the video 571.66 - and where the video should be sped up 573.44 - where effects should be added- go with your feelings 575.84 - Think from a third person's perspective and evaluate how fun it is to see the video 579.8 - and then decide how you should edit 583.44 - Lighting, filming, sound, video editing- I've covered all of them 587.46 - But the most important thing for a Youtuber remains- his content 591.88 - What type of content would you want to make if you wish to become a Youtuber? 595.32 - How will you decide what type of videos you should make and how will you excel in that? 601.4 - The most important thing in content is uniqueness 604.04 - How unique is your content? 606.3 - What most of the people do is look at a successful Youtuber like Technical Guruji 611.04 - and start making their own accounts names- Technical Rakesh, Technical Chintu, Technical Pintu 616.36 - But these channels will never become successful 618.76 - because why would people want to watch you if you are making a copycat channel? 623.06 - The people would obviously prefer to watch Technical Guruji because he is original 627.48 - He (as a channel is) larger than you and you are merely making his copy 630.48 - so why would people prefer to watch you? 633.02 - There should be some uniqueness in your content 635.26 - By uniqueness, I do not mean that you will have to think of an entirely new thing 640.06 - By uniqueness, I mean something fresh and different in your content 643.52 - I am not saying that since Mumbaikar Nikhil and Flying Beast make vlogs, I cannot make them 648.82 - My vlogging channel has some unique things in different aspects 653.4 - Similarly, there are some unique things in the vlogs Mumbaikar Nikhil- which are no there in mine 657.34 - You can distinctly see how these contents are uniquely different on their own 661.94 - Had I copied that style exactly, I would not have been successful 666.34 - Similarly, when you make content, you will have to see what aspect can you be unique in 671.42 - And to make any type of unique content, you either should have the talent for that or you would need to work hard 676.84 - but a combination of both works the best 679.24 - Take my example- I feel that I am naturally talented in researching and analyzing 686.22 - and in videography and filmography 689.58 - But public speaking was something I was not good at, naturally 693.04 - How to speak in front of a camera 695.1 - This is something I have learnt through hardwork and repeated practice 699.08 - So a combination of all- public speaking, analysing, researching and videography 705.4 - when used together to make a video makes a very good one because it employs all these great skills 711.78 - So, you too identify some skill sets that you are naturally good at 715.68 - and the ones that you want to become good at 717.9 - Practice and make yourself even better 719.96 - and then, you can create unique content combining all these different skill sets 726.78 - And finally, when you release your videos, 730.28 - consistency is very important for becoming a Youtuber 732.92 - Keep releasing your videos regularly and with every video, 736.34 - try improving on little things 738.54 - As and when you release videos, you would do more and more practice, 741.64 - you would become better with practice 743.56 - Do not think you will become perfect right with the first video 746.22 - Overall, I think I have covered all the aspects that you should know as a beginner to become a Youtuber 752.48 - and to start your Youtube career 754.86 - I hope you would have found this video to be informative. Share it 758.86 - We will meet again in the next video 762.92 - Or maybe the next vlog! 767.68 - I would like to thank the Vita App for sponsoring this video"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Starting a YouTube Career   1:00 - Behind the Scenes: Studio and Equipment Setup   2:30 - Recording Tips: Lighting and Camera Angles   4:30 - Talking to the Camera: Overcoming Challenges   6:00 - Improving Sound Quality: Simple Tips   7:30 - Writing Scripts: The Backbone of Great Videos   9:00 - Editing Basics: Free Tools and Techniques   10:30 - Creating Unique Content: Standing Out on YouTube   11:30 - Combining Skills: Talent and Hard Work   12:00 - Consistency and Practice: Key to Success  "}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.12 - Computers make no sense. Throw some metal in a box\u00a0 and boom [monke]. What the heck is going on here?\u00a0 11.2 - Inside your PC is a Central Processing Unit,\u00a0 or CPU. It\u2019s basically just a piece of silicon\u00a0\u00a0 15.44 - with billions of microscopic switches called\u00a0 transistors. Depending on the flow of electricity,\u00a0\u00a0 19.44 - they can be on or off, kind of like a light\u00a0 bulb, which gives us two states: 1 and 0.\u00a0 23.76 - The value at one of these switches is called a\u00a0 \u201cbit\u201d. One bit by itself doesn\u2019t really do much.\u00a0\u00a0 28.64 - But put them together, and magic starts to happen. A group of 8 bits is called a \u201cbyte\u201d and can\u00a0\u00a0 32.72 - have 256 different combinations of 0s and 1s.\u00a0 Congratulations! We can now store information\u00a0\u00a0 37.6 - by counting in a system called \u201cbinary\u201d. Every bit represents a power of 2,\u00a0\u00a0 41.08 - 1 meaning the power is included and 0 meaning\u00a0 it\u2019s not, so this number has 1 times 64,\u00a0\u00a0 45.0 - 1 times 4, and 1 times 1, which adds up to 69. This is nice, but for humans, hexadecimal is\u00a0\u00a0 50.2 - even better: It\u2019s often denoted by this 0x and\u00a0 is simply a more readable format than binary:\u00a0\u00a0 54.84 - Four binary bits can take any value from\u00a0 0 to 15. Hexadecimal uses 0-9 and a-f\u00a0\u00a0 60.08 - to represent those values, so a group of four\u00a0 bits can be replaced by one hexadecimal digit.\u00a0 64.88 - Okay. Now that we can store numbers,\u00a0 we just need computers to actually,\u00a0\u00a0 67.72 - you know, do something with them. Using transistors, you can make logic gates,\u00a0\u00a0 71.24 - which are electronic circuits that encapsulate\u00a0 logical statements. You can think of it as a\u00a0\u00a0 74.92 - lightbulb with two switches, where the light\u00a0 only turns on under certain conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 78.28 - For example, only if A AND B are on. By combining logic gates in a clever way,\u00a0\u00a0 82.6 - you can build circuits that perform calculations\u00a0 according to Boolean algebra, which is a system\u00a0\u00a0 86.44 - formalizing mathematical operations in binary. But, even though computers understand 0s and 1s,\u00a0\u00a0 91.4 - for humans, it\u2019s not really all that useful.\u00a0 So, using a character encoding like ASCII,\u00a0\u00a0 95.92 - we can assign a binary number to each\u00a0 character. When you type an A on your keyboard,\u00a0\u00a0 99.32 - it gets translated into this binary code, and as\u00a0 soon as the computer sees this, it says: \u201cAh yes,\u00a0\u00a0 104.52 - that is a capital A.\u201d, and slaps it on the screen. How these devices fit together is handled by an\u00a0\u00a0 108.8 - operating system kernel, like Windows, Linux or\u00a0 Mac, which sits between computer hardware and\u00a0\u00a0 112.68 - applications and manages how they all work\u00a0 together, for example with device drivers.\u00a0 116.64 - Input devices allow you to give the computer\u00a0 instructions with the press of a button,\u00a0\u00a0 120.0 - but at the lowest level, computers only\u00a0 understand instructions in machine code,\u00a0\u00a0 123.2 - which is binary code telling the CPU\u00a0 what to do, and which data to use.\u00a0 126.76 - When it comes to following these instructions,\u00a0 the CPU is kind of like a genius, just with the\u00a0\u00a0 130.88 - memory of a demented goldfish. It can handle\u00a0 any instructions but it cannot store any data,\u00a0\u00a0 135.08 - so it\u2019s only really useful with\u00a0 random access memory or RAM.\u00a0 138.12 - You can imagine it like a grid, where\u00a0 every box can hold one byte of information,\u00a0\u00a0 141.56 - which can be data or instructions, and has an\u00a0 address, so the CPU can access it in four steps:\u00a0 146.28 - Fetch from memory, decode instructions\u00a0 and data and finally, execute and store\u00a0\u00a0 150.12 - the result. This is one machine cycle. Since a program is basically just a list\u00a0\u00a0 153.88 - of instructions in memory, to run it,\u00a0 the CPU executes them one by one in\u00a0\u00a0 157.2 - machine cycles until it\u2019s complete. Oh yeah did\u00a0 I mention that this happens, like, really fast?\u00a0 161.68 - Modern CPUs can do billions of cycles every\u00a0 second, which are coordinated and synchronized\u00a0\u00a0 165.88 - by a clock generator. The speed of this clock\u00a0 is measured in GHz, and people often overclock\u00a0\u00a0 170.12 - their CPUs to improve performance, which is\u00a0 nice, but might just set your PC on fire.\u00a0 174.4 - What\u2019s ever crazier though, is that a CPU has\u00a0 multiple cores, which can all execute different\u00a0\u00a0 178.68 - instructions in parallel, so at the same time.\u00a0 Each core can be split into multiple threads,\u00a0\u00a0 183.48 - which also allows every single core to\u00a0 handle multiple instructions concurrently,\u00a0\u00a0 186.8 - so switch between them really quickly. Okay, that\u2019s cool, but it doesn\u2019t matter\u00a0\u00a0 190.76 - how powerful a computer is if you have no way\u00a0 to give it instructions in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0 194.56 - Typing machine code by hand would probably make\u00a0 you go insane, but luckily, you don\u2019t have to:\u00a0 198.72 - The kernel is wrapped in a shell, which is just\u00a0 a program that exposes the kernel to the user,\u00a0\u00a0 202.56 - allowing for simple instructions in a\u00a0 command line interface with text inputs.\u00a0 206.04 - But the best way to make a computer do\u00a0 something useful is with a programming language,\u00a0\u00a0 209.24 - which uses abstraction, so that instead of\u00a0 this, you can write code that looks like this,\u00a0\u00a0 213.12 - which is then converted into machine code for you. Some languages like Python use an interpreter,\u00a0\u00a0 217.56 - which directly tries to execute the source\u00a0 code line by line. Other languages like C\u00a0\u00a0 221.32 - or GO use a compiler, which converts\u00a0 the entire program into machine code,\u00a0\u00a0 224.72 - before putting it in a file the CPU can execute. Now, every programming language has different\u00a0\u00a0 228.96 - syntax, but there\u2019s some basic\u00a0 tools almost all of them have:\u00a0 231.68 - The most basic way to use data is with\u00a0 variables, which assigns a value to a name,\u00a0\u00a0 235.16 - which can then be reused and modified. Depending on the value, variables can have\u00a0\u00a0 238.8 - different data types. For text, there\u2019s single\u00a0 characters and strings of multiple characters.\u00a0 242.84 - For numbers, there\u2019s integers, which can also\u00a0 be signed if they\u2019re negative, and floating\u00a0\u00a0 246.08 - point numbers for decimal values. They\u2019re called\u00a0 floating point, because the decimal point can\u00a0\u00a0 249.68 - float around to trade off precision with range.\u00a0 This is possible because they use scientific\u00a0\u00a0 253.96 - notation. It\u2019s some number times a power telling\u00a0 you where to put the decimal point, which is\u00a0\u00a0 257.76 - exactly what they look like under the hood. The actual number is stored with binary\u00a0\u00a0 261.24 - fractions. Some fractions like 1/3 can only be\u00a0 approximated in binary with an infinite sum, but,\u00a0\u00a0 266.24 - since memory is not infinite, you have to cut it\u00a0 off at some point, which leads to rounding errors,\u00a0\u00a0 270.0 - causing pretty weird calculations, sometimes. If these are not enough, long and double\u00a0\u00a0 273.84 - use twice the amount of memory to\u00a0 double the range of ints and floats.\u00a0 276.96 - Some languages like Python automatically\u00a0 figure out which type a variable is,\u00a0\u00a0 280.44 - but in a language like C, you have to\u00a0 explicitly declare the type of a variable.\u00a0 284.16 - The value of a variable is stored at some\u00a0 address in memory. Pointers are variables whose\u00a0\u00a0 287.92 - value is the memory address of another variable,\u00a0 which is denoted by this ampersand. So really,\u00a0\u00a0 292.16 - a pointer is just some chunk of memory,\u00a0 pointing to another chunk of memory.\u00a0 295.56 - Since a memory address is just a number,\u00a0 you can add and subtract from it to navigate\u00a0\u00a0 298.92 - through individual bytes of memory.\u00a0 This is called \u201cpointer arithmetic\u201d.\u00a0 301.96 - In some low-level languages like C, you have to\u00a0 manually allocate and free up memory once it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 305.76 - no longer used. This all happens in the heap,\u00a0 which is a part of memory that can dynamically\u00a0\u00a0 309.36 - grow and shrink as the program demands,\u00a0 which allows for more control but makes in\u00a0\u00a0 312.56 - incredibly easy to completely break your code. You could touch memory you\u2019re not supposed to,\u00a0\u00a0 316.44 - or that simply doesn\u2019t exist, which is known as\u00a0 a \u201csegmentation fault\u201d. But also, if there\u2019s some\u00a0\u00a0 320.16 - chunk of memory that\u2019s no longer used, and you\u00a0 forget to free it or you have no way to access\u00a0\u00a0 323.96 - it anymore, that memory is no longer usable. This is called a \u201cmemory leak\u201d and will make\u00a0\u00a0 327.8 - the program slow down and eventually crash. To avoid this mess, high level languages\u00a0\u00a0 331.56 - like Python have built in garbage\u00a0 collectors that manage memory for you.\u00a0 334.96 - Different data types take up a different amount of\u00a0 memory. Integers are most often 4 bytes of memory.\u00a0 339.16 - A single character is most often one\u00a0 byte of memory, and a string is just\u00a0\u00a0 342.08 - multiple character bytes, with a \u201cNUL\u201d\u00a0 character to signal the end of the string.\u00a0 345.2 - Storing multiple items in a contiguous chunk\u00a0 of memory like this is the idea of an array:\u00a0 349.2 - More generally, it\u2019s a list of\u00a0 items with the same data type,\u00a0\u00a0 351.8 - with each item having a numerical index, most\u00a0 often starting at 0. Since the items are next\u00a0\u00a0 356.24 - to each other in memory, by knowing the address\u00a0 of the first item, you can quickly index to any\u00a0\u00a0 360.36 - item in the array by using pointer arithmetic. Arrays are what\u2019s known as a data structure,\u00a0\u00a0 364.56 - which is just a way to organize\u00a0 data to make it easier to work with.\u00a0 367.64 - Retrieving values from an array is blazingly\u00a0 fast, but the size of an array is often fixed\u00a0\u00a0 371.8 - when creating it, so when it\u2019s full, you can\u2019t\u00a0 add anything, and if you don\u2019t use all of it,\u00a0\u00a0 375.24 - it\u2019s just wasted memory, so a more\u00a0 flexible option is a linked list.\u00a0 378.6 - It uses nodes containing a value\u00a0 and a pointer to the next node,\u00a0\u00a0 381.44 - which allows them to be spread apart in memory.\u00a0 Also, it can grow and shrink dynamically,\u00a0\u00a0 384.76 - as you can add and remove any node, and you can\u00a0 reorder it, by simply rearranging the pointers.\u00a0 389.16 - This is great, but they can be impractical, as\u00a0 you have no way to access the last node except\u00a0\u00a0 392.96 - if you traverse every single one before it. But\u00a0 still, both arrays and liked lists are useful,\u00a0\u00a0 397.32 - as they allow you to create queues and stacks. A stack follows the last in, first out principle,\u00a0\u00a0 401.76 - just like taking a pancake from a stack.\u00a0 Practically, just imagine a pointer that\u00a0\u00a0 405.32 - always points to the item that was last added\u00a0 to the structure. Then you can pop, so remove\u00a0\u00a0 409.32 - the last item which increments the pointer back. A queue follows the first in first out principle\u00a0\u00a0 413.72 - and uses two pointers, one for\u00a0 the first item that was added,\u00a0\u00a0 416.2 - and one for the last. Any new item gets added\u00a0 after the last pointer, which is then updated,\u00a0\u00a0 420.36 - and dequeuing starts at the first pointer. Another useful data structure is a hash map,\u00a0\u00a0 424.52 - which is just a collection of key value pairs. It works kind of like an array but uses a hash\u00a0\u00a0 428.56 - function to take a key and assign it to\u00a0 an index, where its value is then stored.\u00a0 432.2 - But sometimes, two different keys can map to the\u00a0 same index, which is called a \u201ccollision\u201d. There\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 436.28 - different ways to deal with this, but one way is\u00a0 to create a linked list at that position in the\u00a0\u00a0 439.76 - array, which makes it a little slower to look up\u00a0 that value, but still, hash maps are incredibly\u00a0\u00a0 444.2 - useful, because you can define the keys that point\u00a0 to every value, and since they\u2019re based on arrays,\u00a0\u00a0 448.12 - retrieving them is blazingly fast. For many problems, it can be very\u00a0\u00a0 451.6 - useful to represent the relationship between\u00a0 different datapoints as a data structure.\u00a0 455.4 - If you take the nodes of a linked list, but\u00a0 allow any node to point to any other node,\u00a0\u00a0 458.84 - you get a graph, where the nodes are\u00a0 connected by edges that can be directed,\u00a0\u00a0 462.24 - undirected and can even carry a weight, which can\u00a0 stand for any metric, such as distance or cost.\u00a0 466.88 - Graphs are useful for analyzing groups inside\u00a0 networks or finding the shortest path between two\u00a0\u00a0 470.76 - points, for example in Google Maps. There\u2019s two\u00a0 main ways to search a graph: Breadth first search,\u00a0\u00a0 475.04 - starts at one node and moves out layer by\u00a0 layer until it finds the target node for the\u00a0\u00a0 478.4 - first time. Depth first search explores every\u00a0 single path fully until it reaches a dead end,\u00a0\u00a0 482.72 - then it backtracks to the last node with a\u00a0 different path and continues from there in\u00a0\u00a0 485.92 - the same way until it finds the target node. A graph where any two nodes are connected by\u00a0\u00a0 490.16 - exactly one path is called a tree, and represents\u00a0 a hierarchy, for example the file system on your\u00a0\u00a0 494.36 - computer. A tree starts at the root and branches\u00a0 out into subtrees, which end in leaf nodes.\u00a0 498.88 - Parent nodes can have any number of child\u00a0 nodes, but oftentimes, binary trees are the\u00a0\u00a0 502.52 - most useful. For example, a binary tree where\u00a0 all the values left of any node are smaller,\u00a0\u00a0 506.44 - and all the values right of it are greater,\u00a0 is called a \u201cbinary search tree\u201d, which makes\u00a0\u00a0 509.64 - finding specific values super fast. If you want to find a target value, just\u00a0\u00a0 513.24 - start at the root. If the target is smaller than\u00a0 that node , go left, if it\u2019s greater, go right,\u00a0\u00a0 517.28 - and repeat this until you find the target. What we just used is a very simple algorithm,\u00a0\u00a0 521.48 - which is just a set of instructions\u00a0 that solves a problem step by step.\u00a0 524.68 - The simplest way to write an algorithm is\u00a0 in the form of a function. It takes inputs,\u00a0\u00a0 528.16 - does something with them, and returns an output. Just like variables, you can then call a function\u00a0\u00a0 532.12 - by its name and pass in different arguments. When calling a function, the function call\u00a0\u00a0 535.72 - gets pushed onto the call stack, which is\u00a0 short-term memory used for executing code,\u00a0\u00a0 539.24 - and as the name implies, it\u2019s based on the stack\u00a0 data structure, which means last in first out.\u00a0 543.52 - To implement algorithms, you often have to\u00a0 compare two values, which you can do with\u00a0\u00a0 546.88 - operators like greater than or equality, and\u00a0 logical expressions such as AND, OR and NOT.\u00a0 551.8 - Expressions like these are simple:\u00a0 they can be true or false, which are\u00a0\u00a0 554.76 - the possible values of the Boolean data type\u00a0 and allow you to write conditional statements:\u00a0 558.92 - If some condition is true, do this, else do that. Booleans can also be used to loop over certain\u00a0\u00a0 564.32 - parts of code. One way is with a while loop: While\u00a0 this condition is true, this code will execute.\u00a0 568.92 - Another way is a for loop, which can iterate\u00a0 over every element inside a data structure\u00a0\u00a0 572.44 - like an array, but can also loop for a specific\u00a0 number of iterations, by setting a starting value,\u00a0\u00a0 576.68 - incrementing it after each iteration, and\u00a0 setting an upper bound with a condition.\u00a0 580.24 - Functions can also call themselves, which is known\u00a0 as \u201crecursion\u201d. This is useful when a problem\u00a0\u00a0 584.2 - can be broken down into smaller identical\u00a0 problems, such as calculating 5 factorial,\u00a0\u00a0 588.08 - which is just 5 times 4 factorial, which\u00a0 is just 4 times 3 factorial and so on.\u00a0 591.84 - But, by default, a recursive function will\u00a0 just keep on calling itself forever. This\u00a0\u00a0 595.52 - means that it keeps pushing more function\u00a0 calls onto the call stack, until the stack\u00a0\u00a0 598.72 - memory is exceeded in a \u201cstack overflow\u201d. To stop this, you have to add a base condition\u00a0\u00a0 603.68 - to a recursive function, which defines when\u00a0 to stop. Only then will the function calls\u00a0\u00a0 607.24 - be executed without crashing your PC. Recursion is cool, but it can be pretty\u00a0\u00a0 611.28 - expensive time and spacewise. So, to minimize the\u00a0 amount of computations needed, past results can be\u00a0\u00a0 615.96 - saved in a cache, so if they come up again,\u00a0 the computer doesn\u2019t have to recompute them\u00a0\u00a0 619.48 - from scratch. This is called \u201cmemoization\u201d. Speaking of performance, to judge how good\u00a0\u00a0 623.36 - an algorithm is, you can look at time and\u00a0 space complexity, so how much time or space\u00a0\u00a0 627.0 - is required to run it. This is measured in Big\u00a0 O notation, which describes the relationship\u00a0\u00a0 630.88 - between growth of input size and number of\u00a0 operations needed to execute the algorithm.\u00a0 634.84 - For example, adding 1 to every number inside an\u00a0 array is O(n), because the number of operations\u00a0\u00a0 639.32 - increases in a linear way as the array grows. What\u2019s relevant is not the exact number of\u00a0\u00a0 643.6 - operations, but rather the trend as the the input\u00a0 size goes to infinity. You see, something like n!\u00a0\u00a0 648.48 - grows way faster than any linear function ever\u00a0 could, so as long as the time complexity is some\u00a0\u00a0 653.28 - kind of linear relation, it\u2019s simplified down to\u00a0 O(n), and the same thing goes for any other group.\u00a0 657.92 - When writing algorithms, there\u2019s some general\u00a0 approaches: For example, when searching an item\u00a0\u00a0 660.189 - in a list, a brute force approach would be to\u00a0 simply check every item until we find the target,\u00a0\u00a0 664.08 - but a more sophisticated approach would be divide\u00a0 and conquer. For example, in binary search,\u00a0\u00a0 670.52 - you cut the problem in half each time by checking\u00a0 the middle element of a list and seeing on which\u00a0\u00a0 672.64 - side the target is until you land on the target. Now, when solving a problem with code, there\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 677.856 - always multiple ways to achieve the same result,\u00a0 which are called programming paradigms. Let\u2019s try\u00a0\u00a0 680.195 - to find the sum of all elements in this list. \u201cDeclarative programming\u201d, describes what the\u00a0\u00a0 682.04 - code does, but not how exactly the computer\u00a0 should do it, whereas \u201cImperative programming\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 686.0 - explicitly describes how the computer should\u00a0 achieve a result with detailed instructions.\u00a0 690.28 - An extension of imperative programming is\u00a0 object-oriented programming, where you can\u00a0\u00a0 693.64 - define classes as blueprints for objects, which\u00a0 are single units consisting of data in the form of\u00a0\u00a0 698.16 - properties and behaviours in the form of methods. To code a call, you begin by defining the\u00a0\u00a0 702.28 - properties as variables, and\u00a0 the methods as functions.\u00a0 705.4 - After encapsulating properties and methods\u00a0 in a class, you can instantiate an object\u00a0\u00a0 709.16 - and use the dot notation to work\u00a0 with its properties and methods.\u00a0 712.4 - Classes make it easy to organize and reuse code,\u00a0 because you can define subclasses that inherit\u00a0\u00a0 716.64 - properties and behaviours of a superclass,\u00a0 but can also extend and override them.\u00a0 720.64 - For example, a RubberDuck subclass might implement\u00a0 quack() with a squeak(), instead. As a result,\u00a0\u00a0 725.16 - rubber rucks can be treated as objects of the\u00a0 Duck class, but behave differently when quack()\u00a0\u00a0 728.88 - is called, which is the concept of \u201cpolymorphism\u201d. But for some problems, none of these traditional\u00a0\u00a0 733.28 - paradigms will work. Let\u2019s say you want to make\u00a0\u00a0 735.12 - a computer recognize which of these images\u00a0 is a bee. The problem is, you can\u2019t really\u00a0\u00a0 739.4 - describe what a bee looks like with code. This is where machine learning comes in,\u00a0\u00a0 742.88 - aka teaching a computer to do a task without\u00a0 explicitly programming it to do that task.\u00a0 747.68 - First you need a lot of data which\u00a0 you split into training and test data.\u00a0 751.4 - Next you choose an algorithm that\u00a0 can change its parameters over time,\u00a0\u00a0 754.36 - for example a neural network, where the weights\u00a0 can be updated to achieve a different result. By\u00a0\u00a0 758.4 - feeding lots and lots of training data into\u00a0 this algorithm you can build a model, whose\u00a0\u00a0 762.04 - accuracy you can then check with the test data. If it\u2019s not quite right, the model can improve\u00a0\u00a0 766.04 - over time by comparing the output to what it\u00a0 should have been, capturing the difference\u00a0\u00a0 769.48 - in an error function, and tweaking its\u00a0 parameters to minimize the difference.\u00a0 772.96 - But no matter how futuristic, bleeding-edge,\u00a0 blazingly fast and optimized it is, if you\u00a0\u00a0 777.12 - want people to actually use the application\u00a0 you wrote, you should probably know about\u00a0\u00a0 780.04 - the internet. It\u2019s a network of computers from\u00a0 all around the globe connected by wires. Like,\u00a0\u00a0 784.24 - literally, the internet is a bunch of thicc\u00a0 cables that run at the bottom of the ocean\u00a0\u00a0 788.08 - along with facilities like Internet Service\u00a0 Providers that connect you to your destination.\u00a0 792.2 - These computers communicate with the Internet\u00a0 Protocol Suite. Every computer on the network\u00a0\u00a0 796.08 - has a unique IP address. Two computers can\u00a0 then transfer data with the transmission\u00a0\u00a0 799.84 - control protocol. It breaks messages into a bunch\u00a0 of packets, sends them through a network of wires,\u00a0\u00a0 804.2 - before the receiving end puts the message back\u00a0 together. If you have a poor internet connection,\u00a0\u00a0 807.88 - you might have experienced \u201cpacket loss\u201d, which is\u00a0 just if some these packets get lost along the way.\u00a0 811.96 - If the internet is the hardware, then the web is\u00a0 the software, which you can use with a browser.\u00a0 816.08 - Every page on the web has a URL. When you type it\u00a0 into your browser, it looks up the IP address of\u00a0\u00a0 820.4 - the server hosting this website with the domain\u00a0 name system, which is like a dictionary mapping\u00a0\u00a0 824.44 - domain names to IP addresses of actual servers. After connecting to it via TCP, your browser,\u00a0\u00a0 829.28 - called the client, uses the hypertext transfer\u00a0 protocol to send an http request to the server,\u00a0\u00a0 833.8 - which then gives a response, ideally\u00a0 containing the contents of the webpage.\u00a0 837.28 - The actual website most often consists of three\u00a0 parts: An HTML file contains all the content of\u00a0\u00a0 841.68 - a website and is basically just a collection of\u00a0 elements, which can be text, links, buttons and\u00a0\u00a0 845.84 - so on. A CSS file controls the visuals and makes\u00a0 a website look nice. But, a website is useless if\u00a0\u00a0 850.64 - pressing nice looking buttons does nothing, so\u00a0 a language like JavaScript adds functionality.\u00a0 855.2 - But sometimes things can go wrong. With\u00a0 every http response comes a response code,\u00a0\u00a0 859.6 - which carries information about the status\u00a0 of the response. For example, 200 means \u201cOK\u201d,\u00a0\u00a0 863.88 - and anything starting with 4 is an error, the\u00a0 most famous one being \u201c404 \u2013 page not found\u201d.\u00a0 868.52 - HTTP requests can carry different methods, for\u00a0 example GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, so retrieve,\u00a0\u00a0 873.64 - add, update and delete information. These are\u00a0 often used by Application Programming Interfaces,\u00a0\u00a0 878.36 - which connect two applications and allow\u00a0 them to interact with each other, for\u00a0\u00a0 881.68 - example store and retrieve data from a database. The most common type of database is a relational\u00a0\u00a0 886.24 - database, which uses tables to store data. Columns of a table contain different attributes,\u00a0\u00a0 890.6 - and rows represent individual datapoints.\u00a0 Also, each table has one unique attribute\u00a0\u00a0 895.24 - called the primary key. A foreign key\u00a0 is the primary key of another table,\u00a0\u00a0 899.04 - establishing a relationship between the two. In\u00a0 this case, each book is connected to an author.\u00a0 903.44 - With a language like SQL, you can write statements\u00a0 to work with data from these tables. You could\u00a0\u00a0 907.56 - look up the titles and authors of all books,\u00a0 whose title starts with \u201cH\u201d, but for that,\u00a0\u00a0 911.52 - we have to join the authors table with\u00a0 the books table on the matching key to\u00a0\u00a0 915.24 - combine two attributes from different\u00a0 tables into one, giving us this output.\u00a0 919.44 - These statements are useful, but you\u2019ve got\u00a0 to be careful, or you might just delete an\u00a0\u00a0 922.8 - entire database with one line of code. But,\u00a0 don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s never happened before.\u00a0 927.48 - Behind every login page is a database with\u00a0 usernames and passwords. When a user tries to\u00a0\u00a0 931.48 - log in, an SQL query is often used to check if the\u00a0 user input matches with an entry in the database.\u00a0 936.68 - That\u2019s good, but, a devious actor could type\u00a0 something like this, which changes the query by\u00a0\u00a0 941.0 - terminating the string early and commenting out\u00a0 the rest, which means as long as this username\u00a0\u00a0 945.04 - exists in the database, access is granted. This is called an SQL injection attack and\u00a0\u00a0 949.427 - is one of the easiest ways hackers\u00a0 get places they\u2019re not supposed to. 963.72 - Hearing about all these concepts is\u00a0 one thing, but to really learn them,\u00a0\u00a0 966.4 - you have to see them in action and use\u00a0 them yourself, which is exactly what you\u00a0\u00a0 969.24 - can do with Brilliant, which has thousands\u00a0 of interactive lessons for everything from\u00a0\u00a0 972.28 - math and data science to programming and AI.

Last year, I have both, 17.397 - OnePlus 11 & OnePlus 12. 20.0 - Oh my God, it's crazy! This was priced at Rs 60-65K. 23.0 - And this one is going to come to Rs 70-75K. That's the 25.314 - expected price. 26.0 - It's going to launch soon, probably by the end of December. 31.0 - Or in the first week of January. 33.0 - This was one of the OnePlus 13 phones that launched in 35.666 - China during the 1st wave. 38.0 - Unboxing & First Impressions, let's start! 41.0 - If you're new here, then do hit LIKE if you enjoy the video! 45.0 - It's never settled, but it's not settled yet. 48.0 - Interesting, the camera module looks a bit small. 52.0 - These days, they look big. 54.0 - This one is not all that big.

13 is. 87.0 - Unboxing & First Impressions 90.0 - Look at this. 92.0 - Alright, these are the 3 phones. 94.0 - Look at how big it is. 96.0 - In my unboxing video, I said that the OnePlus 12 looks 99.223 - heavy & big. 101.0 - Not this one! 102.0 - This is the first time it's coming with Wagan leather. 106.0 - The design has changed now. 108.0 - Earlier it used to be fused with the frame. 110.0 - Not now, it's separate now. 112.0 - And there's a silver line that goes across from the back. 116.0 - And you can see the edge of the Hasselblad. 118.0 - But I'll tell you what, it's flat now. 120.0 - Earlier it used to be rounded. 122.0 - Even the display used to be a 3D curved display. 126.0 - It's still curved, but not so much. 128.0 - This is a quad curved, micro quad curved display. 130.0 - Micro quad curved display & flat sides. 133.0 - This is definitely going to get fingerprints. 135.0 - Because it's shiny. 137.0 - And I'll tell you what, it feels good to hold it in your 139.709 - hand. 141.0 - It's a big phone. 143.0 - It has a big display & a big phone. 145.0 - Comparatively, if I compare it with the OnePlus 12, it's 146.723 - lighter. 148.0 - The battery capacity has increased from 600mAh. 151.0 - But still, I feel it's light. 153.0 - Let's see because it has a 6000mAh battery. 155.0 - It has a 211.7g battery. 158.0 - I think this was 222g or something like that. 161.0 - It has a 223g battery. 163.0 - It's weight has reduced from 11-12g. 166.0 - Whereas the battery capacity has increased from 10-15%. 169.0 - It has a 6000mAh battery. 172.0 - So that's very nice. 174.0 - In fact, I like the in-hand feel. 176.0 - If I talk about the protection, 178.0 - there's a ceramic shield in China, but if it comes here, 179.931 - it'll come with Gorilla Glass. 181.0 - Whatever it is, it's a flagship so it has to fall. 184.0 - 1, 2 & boom! 187.0 - Ok. 189.0 - One more time. 191.0 - 1, 2 & boom! 193.0 - Ok, nothing. 196.0 - Absolutely nothing. 198.0 - By the way, it has all the ports & buttons. 201.0 - You get everything on top, there's an IR blaster, stereo 203.52 - speakers, 205.0 - and then that alert slider is also there. 207.0 - It's good & very satisfying. 208.0 - Let's start the phone. 211.0 - Let's see from inside. 213.0 - Look at the display. 215.0 - The bezels are very thin & there's no chin. 218.0 - I'll say it's not there literally. 220.0 - According to me, the screen-to-body ratio would be above 222.754 - 94%. 224.0 - And that's why it looks manageable. 227.0 - Despite having a 6.82'' display, there are no bezels. 231.0 - This is kind of an all display. 233.0 - It's a 6.82'' 2K resolution display. 235.0 - It's a fast resolution display & it's an LTPO display. 238.0 - There's an adaptive refresh rate of 1-120Hz. 241.0 - It has a brightness of 4500 nits as compared to last time. 244.0 - You can adjust it from here, which is around 800 nits. 249.0 - Overall, it's an excellent display. 251.0 - It's micro curved & it doesn't have the unintended touches 253.45 - like before. 255.0 - It'll be fun for gaming as well. 257.0 - Let's talk about the specifications & performance. 259.0 -

highest. 276.0 - It's closing to 2.8M. 282.0 - It's a Chinese variant & we had an issue while logging in. 286.0 - But it claims to do 120FPS gaming. 292.0 - You should not have any problem playing heavy games on this 296.338 - setting. 298.0 - Battery Life 301.0 - If you're a moderate user & with this kind of battery & 304.384 - charging, 306.0 - you can easily use it for 1.5-2 days. 309.0 - No matter how heavy you use it, it'll last for a day. 312.0 - You can play games all day & the battery will remain. 317.0 - OS 319.0 - It's a Chinese variant & it's on ColorOS. 324.0 - In India, it'll come with OxygenOS skin. 328.0 - It's a Chinese variant & it still needs a lot of 331.147 - permissions. 333.0 - It'll come on Android 15. 335.0 - We'll talk about AI & OS features when it launches in India. 338.0 - Sensors 341.0 - It used to have an optical sensor, but now it has an 343.506 - ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. 346.0 - It's a good thing that the X200 Pro has an ultrasonic 350.356 - fingerprint sensor. 353.0 - So now we're getting flagships with more ultrasonic sensors. 356.0 - Connectivity 358.0 - It has the latest connectivity. 360.0 - It supports 5G, WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC & IR Blaster. 365.0 - So it has all connectivity options & sensors. 369.0 - But that's not what's important. 371.0 - Let's talk about the cameras. 373.0 - When we talk about the OnePlus flagship series cameras, 379.0 - we always say that they should've been improved. 384.0 - In the OnePlus 13, it's a Chinese variant. 388.0 - I won't tell you the complete conclusion. 390.0 - But yes, it has 50MP cameras, 3x periscope, 50MP ultrawide, 395.619 - 50MP primary sensor, OS. 399.0 - Yes, it takes good photos. 401.0 - And it has Hasselblad branding & Hasselblad modes. 407.0 - All that is there. 409.0 - But if you compare it with camera centric phones like X200 411.513 - or iPhone, 413.0 - you'll feel that it could've been better. 415.0 - We've taken a lot of photos. 418.0 - I'm giving you the G-Drive link. 420.0 - Do check it out. 422.0 - But let us wait till it arrives on Indian shores. 425.0 - Then we'll review the camera. 428.0 - Selfies 430.0 - It has a 32MP selfie camera. 432.0 - You can shoot 4K 60FPS with all sensors. 436.0 - I'm talking about rear & front. 438.0 - And you can shoot 8K 30FPS in rear as well. 442.0 - So in terms of videography, it has top line specs. 446.0 - In terms of durability, there's an upgrade. 449.0 - It was IP65 in OnePlus 12, now it's IP68 & IP69. 453.0 - So that's a thumbs up. 455.0 - I'll tell you what, it's price is going to increase as well. 457.0 - It's going to increase from Rs 5-10K. 459.0 - And I haven't told you about the variants. 462.0 - It's base variant is going to be 12-256GB. 464.0 - It'll go all the way up to 24GB RAM & 1TB option. 467.0 - Talking about the 12-256GB base variant, 470.0 - I don't think it's going to come below Rs 70K. 472.0 - It'll go up to Rs 70-75K. 474.0 - And in that price range, you have some really good phones 477.75 - including iPhones. 480.0 - And that too flagship level. 482.0 - So the competition is obviously going to increase. 484.0 - Like it used to be that OnePlus flagship is available for 486.63 - Rs 30K. 488.0 - Now it's going to be available for Rs 75K. 490.0 - And for that kind of competition, 493.0 - they should increase the OS upgrades. 495.0 - I mean, 4G & 5G are not enough anymore. 498.0 - They should give at least 6-7 years of upgrades if they 501.013 - demand the price. 503.0 - And definitely when it comes to India, 505.0 - I want to see an improvement in the camera. 507.0 - I think that is the tilting point where I'll say that 510.0 - if OnePlus's camera seriously gives competition 514.0 - with X200, X-Series, Vivo, iPhones or Samsung phones. 518.0 - This is definitely a worthy competition in that particular 520.45 - price range. 522.0 - But I'll tell you what, OnePlus has a lot of fans. 525.0 - They're going to buy this phone, that's for sure. 528.0 - But let's wait till the launch. 531.0 - It'll definitely wait for that video, it's going to be very 532.638 - interesting. 534.0 - That's all for this OnePlus 13's Unboxing & First 536.161 - Impressions video. 538.0 - Until then Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: OnePlus 13 Unboxing   1:14 - Pricing and Release Expectations   2:05 -

It's more rugged. 70.32 - It can shoot everything all the time. 73.17 - And that got me thinking, 75.66 - well, it's been almost 10 years 77.31 - since I got into these action cameras. 79.59 - How good are the best ones now? 81.84 - Like, you might remember when we strapped one onto Mac 83.61 - that one day and got the perspective of being a dog in 4K. 87.81 - That was 2014. 89.04 - So similar to that, this one also isn't a review, 91.29 - but this one is sponsored by DJI, 93.6 - and they've got their newest, latest 96.12 - and greatest highest end action camera into my hands. 98.22 - So this is the Action 5 Pro. 100.38 - And I figured I'd use this to take a deeper look at 104.28 - the tech that's gonna hopefully enable more of this, 106.5 - more freestyle shooting that I do in 2025. 109.56 - So the first obvious advantage of the action camera 111.54 - is just how tough it's built, 112.65 - because yes, we know smartphones can do an incredible job 115.44 - with video too, but I don't know about you, 117.9 - I'm just not trying to risk my phone 119.46 - in all these precarious scenarios 121.65 - where it would be cool to get an angle, 123.12 - or you put the camera someplace where it could fall 125.22 - or get smacked around or take a beating, 126.87 - because that's my phone. 128.94 - So, this has always been true since the beginning. 130.95 - I mean, this thing is airtight. It's built like a tank. 133.89 - It's waterproof to 20 meters with no case needed, 137.46 - much better than most smartphones. 139.23 - And then it's also super temperature resistant, 141.6 - so it can operate anywhere from 143.7 - negative 20 Celsius to 45 Celsius. 147.51 - I'll also put the Fahrenheit on the screen for y'all. 149.07 - But no freezing or overheating in any of these temperatures, 151.92 - which is kind of nuts. 152.94 - So being more durable and smaller than any smartphone 155.73 - is a pretty obvious advantage to the action camera 157.98 - in a lot of situations, but the other thing about 160.05 - these things is they've gotten a lot of 161.91 - usability upgrades over the years. 163.8 - So I remember back in the day, 165.57 - these used to just be back screens, 168.36 - which was kind of like point and shoot 170.16 - and cross your fingers if you were on the other side. 172.35 - But now, now they've all got these dual screens, 176.13 - so you've got a screen on the front and on the back, 178.29 - which is really convenient 179.91 - for framing things up in either direction. 182.37 - And this one also happens to have 184.23 - these high brightness OLED screens, 186.18 - so even if it's outside or something, super bright, 188.64 - I can use both screens. 190.17 - And since it's a touchscreen and it's actually usable, 192.93 - I can flip through settings and adjust things 195.6 - and get my framing right on either side. 198.45 - It's actually very useful. 199.53 - So this actually levels up in one other way. 201.0 - It has a feature that I think should be more common 203.55 - than it is, which is internal storage. 207.21 - So this camera has 47 gigs of internal storage. 211.56 - Hold on, Zuri. 213.0 - Which means it's saved me a couple times already 214.59 - where I forget to go get a memory card, 216.84 - but I still have enough storage built in to record. 219.81 - Petition for all cameras to have that. 221.61 - I think they should all do it. 222.6 - They should all have internal recording 223.92 - so they can just record whenever, 225.09 - and if I have a card, then I can record more. 227.16 - So this will do... 228.66 - This is 47 gigs, it's two hours. I'm good for a while. 233.04 - All right, run free, go explore. 235.98 - Battery life is very solid, 237.33 - up to four hours nonstop recording 238.95 - if you turn the screen off. 240.36 - And then DGI has a similar clever charger 243.03 - that they have with their drones, 244.53 - basically, where if you put all of the batteries 246.27 - in this case and then charge the case, 248.94 - it just tops each of them up, 250.2 - and the camera itself actually will quick charge 253.05 - if you just plug it right in with USB-C. 254.55 - I don't have a wattage, but I plugged it in at zero 257.25 - and it got to 20% in four minutes, 259.35 - and then it was full in 40. 260.76 - There's also a pressure sensor, 262.14 - so you can tell at any time how deep underwater you are 264.96 - or how high of an altitude you're at, 267.18 - if that's what you're interested in shooting. 268.5 - And also then there's just a bunch of accessories for it 271.29 - for building out and shooting whatever angle, 274.32 - whatever subject you want. 275.91 - So, maybe something kind of weird like this. 279.57 - Give me a second. 280.81 - (balls clattering) 285.803 - (ball snaps) 287.79 - I would normally not at all be comfortable 289.92 - putting my phone out in front of me, 292.62 - hitting golf balls like this, but it's kind of a cool angle. 297.088 - (balls snapping) 302.85 - Oh, that was close. 304.17 - Probably one of the best things about this camera 305.49 - is that it attaches to any accessory you want 307.5 - via this magnetic quick release system at the bottom, 310.56 - which has been pretty standardized 311.79 - with this thing for the past few years. 313.83 - I think other companies are starting to follow along, too. 316.11 - Matter of fact, the benefits of this one specifically, 318.18 - since it's made by DJI, 320.07 - it's directly compatible with other things DJI also makes, 324.12 - like their newest mics, the Mic 2, 325.725 - so you can pair that easily straight to the action cam 329.46 - and get scratch audio from the built in microphones. 332.4 - On top of all of that, it actually 333.63 - plug and plays as a webcam. 335.55 - So when you plug it in, the options come up, 338.07 - select Webcam, and it actually levels up 341.4 - a lot of people's webcam experiences, which is pretty sick. 345.06 - Just remember to brush the dust off of it 347.19 - before you actually do. 348.36 - But it's gotta look good. 349.193 - Like, the whole point of this 350.58 - is that you have this camera everywhere with you, 352.92 - but that the footage actually looks good. 355.05 - So none of this matters if the footage doesn't look good. 358.02 - So this action cam in 2024 has one of the best. 361.301 - It has a one over 1.3 inch sensor that can shoot up to 4K 364.59 - at 120 FPS slow-mo if you want to. 367.59 - There are a couple other high-end smartphones out right now 369.54 - with roughly the same size sensor. 371.04 - I actually think one over 1.3 inches 372.57 - is the same as the Galaxy S23 Ultra, 375.12 - so that's a good example. 376.68 - So, big enough to gather plenty of light. 378.57 - It's an F/2.8 lens. 380.13 - And then on top of that, since it's a dedicated camera, 382.74 - yes, it can shoot LOG. 384.39 - It's got a 10 bit D-Log M, it's got HLG, 387.9 - so that you can get even more dynamic range 389.85 - to mess with in editing after the fact. 392.61 - Of course, you can always just shoot normal mode 394.08 - if you want, but if you ever want that extra range, 395.94 - it's just a quick flip away on the touchscreen settings. 398.22 - And it has one of the widest fields of view. 400.35 - This is the thing about action cameras, 401.7 - is they get super wide, but this one is 155 degrees, 405.69 - so it gives you a ton of room to work with 407.22 - if you wanna shoot in the most ultra wide mode. 409.2 - But there's also less distortion in the more cropped modes 413.34 - depending on what you're shooting. 414.78 - It's actually plenty wide enough to shoot first person stuff 417.27 - like driving, for example, in normal mode, 420.63 - or driving, for example. 423.552 - (ball snaps) 424.385 - No distortion needed. 425.218 - So that brings me to my last point, 427.02 - which is just bang for the buck. 428.85 - Like, a tiny camera like this that you can take everywhere 431.4 - is gonna be cheaper than a smartphone 433.29 - that you put at risk all the time 434.67 - that you actually use for your phone. 436.14 - So, this camera starts at 349 bucks. 440.49 - And also let's not forget 441.323 - the internal storage that it comes with. 442.77 - So you can pick one of these up and however many accessories 444.99 - and mounts and things you want, and run around outside 447.48 - and beat it up and put it at risk all the time, 449.88 - and then at the end of the day, if it's still fine, 453.226 - So I think the main thing that I've taken away from 454.876 - all the fun that I've had with these little cameras is, 457.666 - you know, there's that famous quote, I dunno who said it, 459.556 - but, \"The best camera is the one you have with you.\" 461.413 - You always hear that quoted everywhere. 463.636 - And I think I've been leaning into that more 466.966 - because of how often I don't have my camera with me, 471.526 - like, the cinema camera, the super high end, the Red camera. 475.216 - There are a ton of instances that I can recall 478.486 - of, like, say I'm doing a tech review 480.226 - and there's something really cool that happens on a device, 482.836 - or maybe like a shooting scenario with a smartphone camera, 485.596 - and I can kind of just tell you 487.606 - after the fact about what happened, 489.286 - instead of actually having the camera 490.846 - to point at it and show you. 493.096 - I wanna just have the camera with me more often 495.766 - and just be able to show you the thing. 497.056 - So what I'm definitely not saying is that I'm, like, 498.886 - done with, you know, the super high end, fun cameras. 501.676 - I still love them. 502.636 - There's a reason why we shoot so much stuff 504.736 - with the Reds and in the studio, 506.656 - and that will always have its place. 507.946 - But what my goal is going forward, 510.706 - especially, is to have the camera with me more often. 514.906 - Obviously I'll have my smartphone in my pocket, 516.466 - but just having a camera all the time, everywhere, 519.436 - whether it's in my pocket or in my bag or whatever, 522.226 - so that when that shooting scenario comes up, 524.926 - I can capture it, and that can actually go in the video. 527.446 - That's what I'm trying to do. 528.766 - Hopefully you're with me on that 530.566 - and hopefully you're down to see 532.306 - those videos when they come out. 533.386 - Also, if you wanna see that video, 534.526 - that'll be on the Auto Focus channel pretty soon. 537.196 - It's a pretty crazy one. 538.606 - Anyway, let me know what you think in the comments. 540.406 - Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in the next one. 543.366 - Peace. 544.324 - (upbeat music)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 -

We've seen the 299.569 - 40 Pro & Pro Plus. 301.319 - But you get wireless charging even in the normal non-Pro model. 305.319 - So that's good in terms of specifications. 307.319 - If I talk about the OS, you get XOS which is based on Android 14. 311.319 - And there are 2-3 years security updates. 314.319 - Especially the bloatware that was prevalent 1-1.5 years ago 318.151 - has been removed. 320.319 - You can even uninstall 3rd party apps. 324.319 - You really get a very clean experience. 327.319 - And we had said this when we did the Infinix unboxing, that 329.505 - remove the bloatware. 331.319 - But it's not there anymore. 333.319 - If I talk about the features, it's about the halo lighting. 335.319 - When you're charging or listening to music, you'll see it 336.948 - at the back. 338.319 - There are 2-3 more things that I found interesting. 340.319 - There's an AI wallpaper generator. 342.319 - Yes, it's not the best out there. 344.319 - But you'll be able to generate AI with a prompt. 346.319 - There's a 6-day limit, but that's there. 348.319 - And there's blank data. 350.319 - If there's a medical app that's asking for your personal information, 355.319 - you can set it so that it'll only send blank data. 359.319 - Just to ensure that the app is running. So that's good. 361.319 - And there's a repair mode. 363.319 - If you put it in repair mode, no one will be able to access your data. 366.319 - So there are some good features in the XOS. 368.319 - So that is good. 370.319 - And before moving ahead, I'd like to say that it's a clean UI. 372.319 - So the size of the OS has also been reduced. 375.319 - It hardly takes 18-19GB. 377.319 - If it takes under 20GB, you get nearly 230-228GB out of 256GB. 382.319 - Which is very very good. 384.319 - If I talk about connectivity, there's dual band WiFi, 386.319 - Bluetooth 5.2 support, 14 5G bands. 389.319 - Basically all the bands are supported. 392.319 - No problems, there's dual 4G VoLTE WiFi calling support. 394.319 - And yes, you also have NFC & IR blaster. 396.319 - This phone is also very good for multimedia. 399.319 - Firstly, the display is immersive, bright, colors are good, 401.68 - AMOLED display. 403.319 - So video viewing experience is good. 405.319 - JBL tuned stereo speakers are available. 407.319 - Because of which the audio quality, loudness & volume is also good. 410.319 - So it's also great for multimedia. 412.319 - Absolutely no problems. 414.319 - Widevine L1 is certified, so you can do HD streaming. 416.319 - If you want to watch Netflix prime videos, you can easily 417.86 - do HD streaming. 419.319 - There's no HDR support, but yes, Widevine L1 is available. 422.319 - And if I talk about other features, there's SAR value within limits. 425.319 - Let me tell you about the notification light. 427.319 - You get quad LED lights at the back & dual LEDs at the front. 431.319 - I'll tell you about the camera, but yes, 433.319 - the dual LEDs are useful when you're taking selfies. 435.319 - Then you have FM radio, notification light, 438.319 - the halo lighting at the back, 441.319 - so technically it's there. 443.319 - And yes, there's IP53 certification. 445.319 - Let's talk about the cameras. 447.319 - I thought there were dual cameras, but there are triple cameras. 449.319 - But the primary sensor is the main 108MP primary sensor. 453.319 - The other 2MP sensors are depth sensors. 455.319 - I'm not going to talk about that. 457.319 - There's a 32MP selfie sensor. 459.319 - And you can shoot 2K videos. 461.319 - We've taken photos & samples. 463.319 - If you want to see the original quality, I'm giving you the G-Drive link. 465.319 - Go & check it out. 467.319 - In normal conditions, the photos are good. 470.319 - Generally, Infinix phones are not known for the camera. 472.319 - But yes, they are improving. 474.319 - You go & see the photos & let us know your thoughts in the comments. 477.319 - If I talk about the camera app, 479.319 - you get all the features you expect. 481.319 - Let me tell you, because it's 108MP, you get 3x lossless zoom 487.319 - So you won't lose much quality by zooming in 3x. 491.319 - And if I talk about the features, 493.319 - there's film, portrait, AI cam, all the features are there. 496.319 - And as mentioned in the video, you can shoot 2K 30FPS in 498.59 - the front & back. 500.319 - But overall, if you look at the Infinix Note 40 5G, 505.319 - the standout feature is wireless charging, 508.319 - which is unheard of in the price range under Rs 20K. 509.319 - And another thing about the charging, 512.32 - you get by-pass charging support. 514.32 - If you're playing games, you don't have to use the battery. 517.32 - So that's there. 519.32 - And you can also do reverse wireless charging. 521.32 - You can charge the buds with the phone. 523.32 - And if I talk about the gaming performance, 526.32 - you can play games on medium settings. 529.32 - The display & speakers are good, so you're going to enjoy it. 532.32 - You can play 40FPS BGMI games without any problems. 535.32 - There's also smart charging support. 536.32 - In fact, it has a power management chipset called Cheetah X1 541.32 - So it's good for fast & wireless charging. 545.32 - If I talk about the sensors, 547.32 - all the sensors are there & they're generally side-mounted. 550.32 - Again, in the Rs 15-18K price range, 552.32 - it's not always side-mounted. 554.32 - It has an in-display fingerprint sensor & face unlock works well. 556.32 - So what do you think about the Infinix Note 40 5G? 558.32 - If I talk about the display, 560.32 - you get decent performance & a decent camera for multimedia. 563.32 - Overall, for the Rs 17-18K price range, you're getting a lot! 568.32 - Before ending the video, 570.32 - this video is a collaboration with Infinix. 573.32 - But we've tested it & we've shared the results with you. 577.32 - If you're interested, you can buy it right now. 579.32 - There are offers on Flipkart for a no cost EMI of Rs 1,333. 584.32 - So go ahead & check it out! 586.32 - This is the Infinix Note 40 5G. 589.32 - If you enjoyed the video, then do hit LIKE! 590.32 - If you have any questions, do ask them in the COMMENTS section. 594.32 - That's all for this video. 595.169 - Until then Keep Trakin & Stay Safe!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction to the Infinix Note 40 5G 0:28 - Unique Features and Pricing Highlights 1:18 - Unboxing and Accessories Overview 2:32 - Design and Build Quality 3:45 - Display and Specifications 5:00 - Software, Features, and Clean UI 6:18 - Camera Features and Performance 7:45 - Gaming, Performance, and Charging Capabilities 8:52 - Final Thoughts and Offers"}]}

So that is a topic of this\u00a0 video. Now a server is basically a dedicated\u00a0\u00a0 7.57 - computer that provides services on behalf of\u00a0 clients, such as ordinary desktop computers\u00a0\u00a0 13.93 - or workstations. So it's a centralized machine\u00a0 where multiple clients connect to, either over\u00a0\u00a0 20.14 - the Internet or in a local area network, and they\u00a0 connect to a server for a specific service.  So\u00a0\u00a0 26.5 - for example, that service could be to retrieve a\u00a0 website, to access data, or email, and so on. Now\u00a0\u00a0 33.43 - a server could be dedicated to handle one of these\u00a0 services only, where you would have one server\u00a0\u00a0 39.22 - it dedicated for a website, one server for data\u00a0 storage, and a server for email. And this model is\u00a0\u00a0 45.79 - what larger organizations use. Or you can also set\u00a0 up a server to handle each of these services on\u00a0\u00a0 52.09 - the same machine which is what typically happens\u00a0 in smaller organizations. So depending upon which\u00a0\u00a0 58.45 - setup is used it all depends on the needs of an\u00a0 organization. Now when people talk about a server\u00a0\u00a0 65.59 - generally they are referring to a powerful\u00a0 centralized computer that clients connect to\u00a0\u00a0 71.44 - over a network, and they would be correct on that.\u00a0 However a server is not just a physical computer.\u00a0\u00a0 78.04 - A server is actually a role that a computer takes.\u00a0 Because any ordinary desktop computer can be set\u00a0\u00a0 85.93 - up as a server and it doesn't necessarily have to\u00a0 be a powerful computer. So for example you can set\u00a0\u00a0 92.23 - up a network in your home where you can have an\u00a0 ordinary desktop computer serve as a file server.\u00a0\u00a0 98.53 - The computer would have those files in a shared\u00a0 folder and then other computers can connect to\u00a0\u00a0 104.62 - it to access those files.  Or you can also use\u00a0 a desktop computer to serve as a web server,\u00a0\u00a0 111.19 - where you would install the website data on that\u00a0 computer and then the other computers can connect\u00a0\u00a0 117.04 - to it and retrieve the webpage.  However desktop\u00a0 computers do have their limitations because they\u00a0\u00a0 124.18 - are not designed to handle a large workload and\u00a0 they can't handle a lot of incoming connections\u00a0\u00a0 130.3 - from users.  And this is not only because of their\u00a0 inferior hardware, but it's also because of software.\u00a0\u00a0 136.45 - Because desktop operating systems are only able to\u00a0 handle a limited amount of concurrent connections.\u00a0\u00a0 142.51 - Now servers need to be up and running 24/7 because\u00a0 they are vital to an organization.  And if a server\u00a0\u00a0 151.69 - does go down then that could jeopardize a business\u00a0 or an organization.  So this is why servers need to\u00a0\u00a0 158.92 - be more reliable.  They need to be built with robust\u00a0 hardware that's able to run non-stop with little\u00a0\u00a0 165.76 - to no downtime.  So for example, a desktop would\u00a0 use a processor that's designed obviously for\u00a0\u00a0 173.38 - desktops, such as the Intel core series processors.\u00a0 And a server would use a processor designed for\u00a0\u00a0 180.58 - servers such as the Intel Xeon processor.  A server\u00a0 processor needs to be fast and had the ability to\u00a0\u00a0 187.51 - perform a lot of tasks simultaneously.  Now both\u00a0 of these processors are powerful but there are\u00a0\u00a0 194.68 - some differences.  So for example, Xeon processors\u00a0 support a multi processing environment.  So they\u00a0\u00a0 201.73 - are designed to work with other processors.  Which\u00a0 means you can put two or more Xeon processors on\u00a0\u00a0 208.39 - a motherboard designed for servers, which is what\u00a0 a lot of servers need to handle a large workload.\u00a0\u00a0 214.87 - But desktop processors do not support this, they\u00a0 are only designed to work by themselves and not\u00a0\u00a0 221.62 - with other processors.  And another difference\u00a0 is that Xeon processors support ECC RAM, which\u00a0\u00a0 229.51 - is error code correcting memory.  And this type\u00a0 of memory is what's mainly used in servers.  Now\u00a0\u00a0 235.39 - servers need to be up and running at all times\u00a0 and memory errors could bring down a server and\u00a0\u00a0 241.33 - what ECC does is that it detects if the data was\u00a0 correctly processed by the RAM module and it makes\u00a0\u00a0 248.14 - a correction if it needs to to prevent memory\u00a0 errors.  So using ECC memory in servers is just\u00a0\u00a0 255.31 - an extra precaution to guard against any errors to\u00a0 prevent a server from shutting down and Intel Core\u00a0\u00a0 262.33 - processors do not support ECC Ram, however AMD\u00a0 processors do so support it.  Xeon processors can also\u00a0\u00a0 271.21 - support a larger amount of RAM.  They would have\u00a0 a larger cache memory.  And they would also have\u00a0\u00a0 277.12 - a higher core count than desktop processors.  And a\u00a0 server should also have hot swappable hard drives\u00a0\u00a0 284.92 - in a RAID configuration because if a hard drive\u00a0 were to fail then no data loss what happened and\u00a0\u00a0 291.1 - the server would still be up and running because\u00a0 of RAID.  RAID is what copies that data on multiple\u00a0\u00a0 297.04 - disks and if a hard drive were to fail then it\u00a0 can be removed and replaced without shutting\u00a0\u00a0 303.1 - down the server.  And then RAID would rebuild\u00a0 the data on the new hard drive automatically. 310.68 - And a server should also have\u00a0redundant power supplies to\u00a0\u00a0 314.91 - keep the server up and running\u00a0 in case of a power supply failure. 321.98 - And a server also needs to use a server operating\u00a0 system, such as Linux, Windows Server, mac OS server\u00a0\u00a0 330.62 - and so on.   Server operating systems are robust and\u00a0 stable and they are designed to run non-stop and\u00a0\u00a0 338.15 - are able to handle thousands of concurrent\u00a0 connections.  Now there are many different\u00a0\u00a0 344.21 - types of servers and when I mean types I'm\u00a0 talking about the type of service that the\u00a0\u00a0 349.79 - server provides.  So for example, a web server.  \u00a0 A web server is what hosts a website.  So any\u00a0\u00a0 356.87 - website that you go to with your web browser,\u00a0 you are connecting over the Internet to that\u00a0\u00a0 362.15 - web server to pull up the web site you want.  The\u00a0 web server will contain all of the website's\u00a0\u00a0 367.64 - data, including the HTML code and graphics and\u00a0 it will also be running the web server software.\u00a0\u00a0 373.85 - another type of server is an email server an\u00a0 email server is what facilitates the sending\u00a0\u00a0 380.63 - And receiving of email and you would access the\u00a0 email using your web browser or you can use an\u00a0\u00a0 386.66 - email client such as Outlook or Thunderbird\u00a0 using email protocols such as IMAP,, POP, and\u00a0\u00a0 393.65 - SMTP.  And a database server is another type\u00a0 of server.  This type of server stores data\u00a0\u00a0 400.22 - on the backend and then it's retrieved from\u00a0 computers on the front end, for example using\u00a0\u00a0 405.98 - queries such as SQL.  So these are just a few\u00a0 examples of what servers do but there is a lot\u00a0\u00a0 413.51 - more.  So thank you everyone for watching this\u00a0 video on servers and the difference between\u00a0\u00a0 418.97 - servers and desktop computers.

video i will share the three major mistakes almost\u00a0 every data analyst makes so stay tuned for those\u00a0\u00a0 47.28 - the first thing every beginner data analyst needs\u00a0 to pick is a tool or programming language for data\u00a0\u00a0 52.88 - analysis i personally started off with Excel is\u00a0 that the best tool there is for data analysis no\u00a0\u00a0 58.56 - if i could go back in time would have started\u00a0 with something else also no because apparently\u00a0\u00a0 63.92 - getting good at Excel was enough for my first\u00a0 data analysis job and i personally recommend\u00a0\u00a0 68.72 - every single data analyst to start off with\u00a0 Excel it's easy to learn used in almost every\u00a0\u00a0 73.44 - company and it has a wide range of applications\u00a0 for data analysis but this is also it's pitfall\u00a0\u00a0 79.52 - although you can do a lot of different things\u00a0 in Excel it's not designed specifically for\u00a0\u00a0 84.32 - data analysis meaning it has its limitations\u00a0 you want to work with a very large data set\u00a0\u00a0 89.28 - well good luck not punching through your computer\u00a0 screen after Excel crashes for the 27th time\u00a0\u00a0 96.48 - Excel is perfect for starting out but once\u00a0 you've mastered excel it's time to move on\u00a0\u00a0 101.36 - to the more serious tools and the most logical\u00a0 tool to learn next is SQL next to Excel it is\u00a0\u00a0 107.2 - apparently the second most requested skill in data\u00a0 analyst job openings huge thanks to Luke Barousse\u00a0\u00a0 113.6 - for actually scraping a lot of Linkedin\u00a0 job openings to come up with these facts\u00a0\u00a0 117.84 - you're a legend man thank you what up that nerds\u00a0 and the reason SQL is so in demand is because\u00a0\u00a0 122.4 - it doesn't have the same limitations as Excel\u00a0 why is my accent suddenly changing to southern\u00a0\u00a0 130.48 - i don't know what with SQL you can extract\u00a0 transform and load very large data sets but\u00a0\u00a0 135.52 - the best thing about it is that SQL has its own\u00a0 very easy to use programming language it's a great\u00a0\u00a0 140.88 - tool to add to your skill set as a data analyst\u00a0 while also being a great stepping stone to some\u00a0\u00a0 145.44 - more serious programming but before we get to\u00a0 that every data analyst needs a visualization\u00a0\u00a0 150.4 - tool there are dozens of BI tools out there but\u00a0 having worked for multiple companies and projects\u00a0\u00a0 156.72 - and having looked at probably hundreds of data\u00a0 analyst job openings i've come to realize that\u00a0\u00a0 161.36 - the majority of companies are looking for people\u00a0 with experience with Tableau Power BI and Qlikview\u00a0\u00a0 167.76 - here's the pros and cons of each so you can decide\u00a0 which suits you best Power BI is part of the\u00a0\u00a0 172.56 - Microsoft stack so it works smoothly with Excel\u00a0 and Sharepoint besides that it has a free version\u00a0\u00a0 178.32 - and even the paid versions are relatively budget\u00a0 friendly compared to the other BI tools next up is\u00a0\u00a0 184.0 - Tableau Tableau is a BI tool with more extensive\u00a0 data visualization capabilities than Power BI\u00a0\u00a0 190.08 - it seems to be just a bit more in demand in\u00a0 the job market than Power BI it comes with\u00a0\u00a0 195.12 - a much higher price tag though making it harder\u00a0 to learn if you're starting out by yourself and\u00a0\u00a0 199.68 - then there's Qlikview using in-memory technology\u00a0 making it a super fast and responsive way of doing\u00a0\u00a0 206.32 - business intelligence but also a pretty high price\u00a0 tag and also it's less in demand than Tableau and\u00a0\u00a0 212.56 - Power BI i personally picked Power BI as my BI\u00a0 tool although it might not be the fastest BI tool\u00a0\u00a0 217.92 - out there or the one with the most extensive\u00a0 capabilities in my opinion it can give you\u00a0\u00a0 222.24 - the most bang for buck when it comes to becoming a\u00a0 full-time data analyst before we move on to how to\u00a0\u00a0 227.84 - actually get good at data analysis and land that\u00a0 first job there's one more thing we need to do\u00a0\u00a0 232.72 - as a data analyst after you've mastered a BI tool\u00a0 it's time to get into the more advanced analytics\u00a0\u00a0 238.48 - i'm talking about which programming language\u00a0 to use when it comes to data analysis or data\u00a0\u00a0 243.6 - science software developers and programmers get to\u00a0 choose between java javascript ruby c-sharp python\u00a0\u00a0 250.88 - r c c++ and many more luckily for us data analysts\u00a0 we only have to choose between two programming\u00a0\u00a0 257.68 - languages r and python so which one should you\u00a0 pick i chose python but if i could go back in\u00a0\u00a0 264.08 - time i would choose python why well even though\u00a0 they're actually very similar r is a programming\u00a0\u00a0 270.08 - language focused more on statistical analysis\u00a0 well python is a more general purpose programming\u00a0\u00a0 276.16 - language that also happens to be very good for\u00a0 data analysis and although r might be a little\u00a0\u00a0 281.52 - bit easier to learn i would still go for python as\u00a0 it's the probably probably probably the number one\u00a0\u00a0 288.48 - programming language in the world meaning if you\u00a0 get good at python for data analysis it might also\u00a0\u00a0 293.68 - open the door to a lot of different job\u00a0 opportunities so the path i took is Excel\u00a0\u00a0 300.4 - SQL Power BI and Python this is the path i would\u00a0 recommend as it worked out great for me but you\u00a0\u00a0 306.64 - can start off with any language or tool that\u00a0 suits you best because whatever you pick your\u00a0\u00a0 311.92 - first language or tool will definitely not be your\u00a0 last so now that you know which tools to learn\u00a0\u00a0 317.52 - let's talk about how to actually learn it and\u00a0 this is where beginners make the first major\u00a0\u00a0 322.0 - mistake the mistake most beginners make is that\u00a0 they try to learn by watching others this is how\u00a0\u00a0 327.44 - most people learn data analysis some people go to\u00a0 Udemy and watch multiple 20 plus hour courses and\u00a0\u00a0 333.84 - probably not even finish all of them or they watch\u00a0 youtube videos watching other people analyze data\u00a0\u00a0 339.04 - but without actually writing code or analyzing\u00a0 data themselves they give themselves a false\u00a0\u00a0 344.16 - sense of progress because analyzing data in your\u00a0 head is very different than from actually doing it 353.6 - data analysis in your head is very different\u00a0 from actually analyzing data stumbling upon\u00a0\u00a0 359.92 - faulty data and debugging for hours so what is\u00a0 the right way to do it? the answer is very simple:\u00a0\u00a0 365.36 - learn by doing you just need to get the\u00a0 reps in and start coding and analyzing\u00a0\u00a0 369.92 - data by yourself for Excel i would recommend\u00a0 a website called www.excel-practice-online.com\u00a0\u00a0 375.76 - a free website where you learn to use Excel\u00a0 by doing from the basics to the most advanced\u00a0\u00a0 380.96 - functionalities for SQL i would recommend the\u00a0 website www.w3schools.com/sql for Power BI i\u00a0\u00a0 387.6 - would recommend Datacamp there's free courses\u00a0 and also paid ones for python you can go to\u00a0\u00a0 392.48 - this free website called learnpython.org whether\u00a0 you're practicing every day at your current job\u00a0\u00a0 398.64 - so you can make that switch to a data analysis\u00a0 career or whether you're still studying you need\u00a0\u00a0 403.44 - to practice every single day only this way will\u00a0 you experience what it's actually like working as\u00a0\u00a0 409.04 - a data analyst analysis working as a data analyst\u00a0 only then will you learn what it's like to debug\u00a0\u00a0 415.12 - your own code or formulas because to be honest\u00a0 that's what you will spend the most time on\u00a0\u00a0 420.24 - debugging faulty code or correcting faulty data\u00a0 being a data analyst is awesome but this is also\u00a0\u00a0 427.68 - the second major mistake most beginners make they\u00a0 try to solve every problem themselves the fact is\u00a0\u00a0 434.0 - that error you just got in Power BI there's a very\u00a0 big chance someone already has experienced exactly\u00a0\u00a0 439.68 - the same error as you and that's good news for you\u00a0 because now you don't have to look for the cause\u00a0\u00a0 444.16 - of the error you just have to copy part of the\u00a0 error message in google and you probably end up on\u00a0\u00a0 449.2 - some stack overflow website where someone explains\u00a0 exactly how to solve this error let's be honest\u00a0\u00a0 454.96 - copying code from stack overflow is like 80%\u00a0 of any developer programmer or data analyst job\u00a0\u00a0 462.08 - data analyst is awesome okay now that you know\u00a0 what tool and programming language to pick\u00a0\u00a0 466.8 - and how to actually learn it it's time to build\u00a0 your portfolio and this will help you build\u00a0\u00a0 471.6 - out an attractive CV for recruiters on Linkedin\u00a0 recruiters i always talk like a bit this i know\u00a0\u00a0 477.6 - programmer so strange programming language\u00a0 and recruiters talk to me every day now if\u00a0\u00a0 482.96 - you have a job where you can apply data analytics\u00a0 already then do so right away if you don't really\u00a0\u00a0 487.92 - do anything data analytics related like sales for\u00a0 example then try to build a report or a dashboard\u00a0\u00a0 494.56 - showing some key metrics or KPI's that you\u00a0 can show to your manager he will appreciate\u00a0\u00a0 499.28 - it and you will get to learn your data analysis\u00a0 skills and if you can't apply to your current job\u00a0\u00a0 503.92 - or if you're still studying then start a project\u00a0 on your own at home because in the end it's about\u00a0\u00a0 509.6 - getting that data analyst job and the best way\u00a0 to do that is as follows pimp up your Linkedin\u00a0\u00a0 515.2 - profile i've made a video before where i give\u00a0 my top five Linkedin profile tips to attract\u00a0\u00a0 520.0 - recruiters on Linkedin and i'll summarize it here\u00a0 for you make sure you put data analysts in as many\u00a0\u00a0 525.68 - places as you can in your profile Linkedin is a\u00a0 search engine and if recruiters search for data\u00a0\u00a0 530.4 - analysts you want to be found you want to be on\u00a0 top of that list so make sure your header contains\u00a0\u00a0 534.72 - the word data analyst in your work experience\u00a0 if you've done something data analyst related\u00a0\u00a0 538.64 - put in the keyword data analyst once your Linkedin\u00a0 profile is set up there's two things you can do\u00a0\u00a0 543.44 - start applying to every single data analyst\u00a0 job you can find on Linkedin or any other job\u00a0\u00a0 548.08 - platform or the second way which i prefer is if\u00a0 you've set up your Linkedin profile correctly\u00a0\u00a0 553.44 - then recruiters will soon start hunting you they\u00a0 will invite you to job interviews for data analyst\u00a0\u00a0 558.8 - positions which brings me to major mistake number\u00a0 three don't quit well do quit let me explain you\u00a0\u00a0 566.8 - see the second best decision i have ever made\u00a0 in my life was becoming a data analyst and to\u00a0\u00a0 572.96 - become one yourself the only thing you have to do\u00a0 is don't quit whether it will take you one week\u00a0\u00a0 578.72 - one month or one year if you keep applying if you\u00a0 keep improving your skills updating your CV you\u00a0\u00a0 585.28 - will land that job eventually and trust me once\u00a0 you do land that first data analyst job a world\u00a0\u00a0 591.76 - of opportunities will open up for you you can grow\u00a0 your skills into a senior data analyst or become\u00a0\u00a0 597.04 - a freelance data analyst or what i eventually\u00a0 did quit my job as a data analyst the single\u00a0\u00a0 603.28 - best decision in my life was quitting my job\u00a0 as a data analyst you see becoming a freelance\u00a0\u00a0 609.36 - data analyst gave me the resources to quit my\u00a0 job and pursue a completely different career\u00a0\u00a0 615.76 - creating my own brand while traveling the world\u00a0 do not subscribe to my youtube channel i'm 100%\u00a0\u00a0 621.2 - serious if you're looking for advice and tips on\u00a0 how to become a data analyst and how to build a\u00a0\u00a0 626.0 - data analyst career for the rest of your life then\u00a0 i would recommend subscribing to Luke Barousse\u00a0\u00a0 630.24 - what up nerds as he makes way better videos than\u00a0 me but if you view being a data analyst as a\u00a0\u00a0 636.72 -

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.0 - Transcriber: Gustavo Rocha Reviewer: Marssi Draw 9.003 - Hi everyone. 11.825 - Two year ago, my life changed forever. 16.625 - My wife Kelsey and I 19.261 - welcomed our daughter Lela into the world. 23.033 - Now, becoming a parent is an amazing experience. 27.456 - Your whole world changes over night. 30.704 - And all of your priorities change immediately. 33.285 - So fast that it makes it really difficult to process sometimes. 39.294 - Now, you also have to learn a tremendous amount about being a parent 43.547 - like, for example, how to dress your child. 46.82 - (Laughter) 47.954 - This was new to me. 50.091 - This is an actual outfit,  I thought this was a good idea. 53.844 - And even Lela knows that it's not a good idea. (Laughter) 59.558 - So there is so much to learn and so much craziness all at once. 64.409 - And to add to the craziness,  Kelsey and I both work from home, 68.533 - we're entrepreneurs, we run our own businesses. 71.223 - So, Kelsey develops courses online for yoga teachers. 76.992 - I'm an author. 78.333 - And so, I'm working from home, Kelsey's working from home. 80.782 - We have an infant and we're trying to make sure 83.901 - that everything gets done that needs done. 86.725 - And life is really, really busy. 92.357 - And a couple of weeks into this amazing experience, 96.718 - when the sleep deprivation really kicked in, 100.247 - like around week eight, 102.299 - I had this thought, and it was the same thought 105.732 - that parents across the ages, internationally, 109.773 - everybody has had this thought, which is: 112.467 - I am never going to have free time ever again. 118.054 - (Laughter) 119.183 - Somebody said it's true. 122.403 - It's not exactly true, 125.214 - but it feels really, really true in that moment. 129.866 - And this was really disconcerning to me, 132.075 - because one of the things that I enjoy 135.484 - more than anything else is learning new things. 139.428 - Getting curious about something and diving in 142.261 - and fiddling around and  learning through trial and error. 145.164 - And eventually becoming pretty good at something. 148.44 - And without this free time, 152.336 - I didn't know how I was ever  going to do that ever again. 156.405 - And so, I'm a big geek, 158.877 - I want to keep learning things, I want to keep growing. 162.07 - And so what I've decided to do was, 165.087 - go to the library, and go to the bookstore, 167.784 - and look at what research says about 169.922 - how we learn and how we learn quickly. 173.523 - And I read a bunch of books, I read a bunch of websites. 176.834 - And tried to answer this question, 179.091 - how long does it take to acquire a new skill? 183.04 - You know what I found? 185.117 - 10,000 hours! 189.438 - Anybody ever heard this? 191.2 - It takes 10,000 hours. If you want to learn something new, 194.134 - if you want to be good at it, 195.584 - it's going to take 10,000 hours to get there. 197.934 - And I read this in book after book, in website after website. 201.455 - And my mental experience of reading all of this stuff was like: 208.421 - No!! 210.799 - I don't have time! I don't have 10,000 hours. 214.539 - I am never going to be able to learn anything new. 219.088 - Ever again. (Laughter) 222.421 - But that's not true. 223.479 - So, 10,000 hours, just to give you a rough order of magnitude, 226.559 - 10,000 hours is a full-time job for five years. 232.422 - That's a long time. 234.008 - And we've all had the experience of learning something new, 236.364 - and it didn't take us anywhere close to that amount of time, right? 240.439 - So, what's up? There's something kinda funky going on here. 243.505 - What the research says and what we expect, and have experiences, 247.078 - they don't match up. 249.416 - And what I found, here's the wrinkle: 252.993 - The 10,000 hour rule came out of studies of expert-level performance. 259.722 - There's a professor at Florida State University, 262.228 - his name is K. Anders Ericsson. 264.226 - He is the originator of the 10,00 hour rule. 266.725 - And where that came from is, he studied professional athletes, 271.261 - world class musicians, chess grand masters. 275.763 - All of this ultra competitive folks in ultra-high performing fields. 280.775 - And he tried to figure out how long does it take 283.751 - to get to the top of those kinds of fields. 286.811 - And what he found is, the more deliberate practice, 289.668 - the more time that those individuals spend 292.194 - practicing the elements of whatever it is that they do, 295.304 - the more time you spend, the better you get. 297.246 - And the folks at the tippy top of their fields 300.165 - put in around 10,000 hours of practice. 305.101 - Now, we were talking about the game of telephone a little bit earlier. 309.442 - Here's what happened: 311.236 - an author by the name of Malcolm Gladwell 313.458 - wrote a book in 2007 called \"Outliers: The Story of Success\", 317.901 - and the central piece of that book was the 10,000 hour rule. 321.592 - Practice a lot, practice well, and you will do extremely well, 325.642 - you will reach the top of your field. 327.367 - So, the message, 329.472 - what Dr. Ericsson was actually saying is, 332.455 - it takes 10,000 hours to get at the top of an ultra competitive field 337.425 - in a very narrow subject, that's what that means. 341.857 - But here's what happened: ever since Outliers came out, 345.294 - immediately came out, reached the top of best seller lists, 347.449 - stayed there for three solid months. 350.056 - All of a sudden the 10,000 hour rule was everywhere. 354.171 - And a society-wide game of telephone started to be played. 360.022 - So this message, it takes 10,000 hours to reach the top of an ultra competitive field, 364.955 - became, it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert at something, 369.927 - which became, 371.366 - it takes 10,000 hours to become good at something, 375.667 - which became, 377.192 - it takes 10,000 hours to learn something. 381.455 - But that last statement, it takes 10,000 hours to learn something, 385.337 - is not true. It's not true. 388.6 - So, what the research actually says -- 393.346 - I spent a lot of time here at the CSU library 396.217 - in the cognitive psychology stacks 'cause I'm a geek. 399.523 - And when you actually look at the studies of skill acquisition, 404.216 - you see over and over a graph like this. 408.039 - Now, researchers, whether they're studying a motor skill, 411.694 - something you do physically or a mental skill, 414.328 - they like to study things that they can time. 417.174 - 'Cause you can quantify that, right? 419.185 - So, they'll give research participants a little task, 422.452 - something that requires physical arrangement, 424.156 - or something that requires learning a little mental trick, 428.925 - and they'll time how long a participant takes to complete the skill. 433.357 - And here's what this graph says, when you start -- 436.095 - so when researchers gave participants a task, it took them a really long time, 440.398 - 'cause it was new and they were horrible. 443.053 - With a little bit of practice, they get better and better and better. 446.651 - And that early part of practice is really, really efficient. 450.632 - People get good at things with just a little bit of practice. 456.021 - Now, what's interesting to note is that, 459.663 - for skills that we want to learn for ourselves, 462.869 - we don't care so much about time, right? 465.736 - We just care about how good we are, whatever good happens to mean. 469.283 - So if we relabel performance time to how good you are, 474.943 - the graph flips, and you get his famous and widely known, 479.346 - this is the learning curve. 481.274 - And the story of the learning curve is when you start, 483.852 - you're grossly incompetent and you know it, right? 486.567 - (Laughter) 488.635 - With a little bit of practice, you get really good, really quick. 491.997 - So that early level of improvement is really fast. 495.715 - And then at a certain point you reach a plateau, 498.63 - and the subsequent games become much harder to get, 501.96 - they take more time to get. 504.659 - Now, my question is, I want that, right? 508.62 - How long does it take from starting something 511.605 - and being grossly incompetent and knowing it 515.265 - to being reasonably good? 517.575 - In hopefully, as short a period of time as possible. 522.329 - So, how long does that take? 524.539 - Here's what my research says: 20 hours. 529.518 - That's it. You can go from knowing nothing 533.163 - about any skill that you can think of. 535.739 - Want to learn a language? Want to learn how to draw? 539.175 - Want to learn how to juggle flaming chainsaws? 542.294 - (Laughter) 543.32 - If you put 20 hours of focused deliberate practice into that thing, 548.532 - you will be astounded. 550.964 - Astounded at how good you are. 554.135 - 20 hours is doable, 555.645 - that's about 45 minutes a day for about a month. 559.956 - Even skipping a couple days, here and there. 562.066 - 20 hours isn't that hard to accumulate. 565.221 - Now, there's a method to doing this. 568.1 - Because it's not like you can just start fiddling around for about 20 hours 571.097 - and expect these massive improvements. 573.044 - There's a way to practice intelligently. 575.713 - There's a way to practice efficiently, 577.997 - that will make sure that you invest those 20 hours 581.051 - in the most effective way that you possibly can. 583.592 - And here's the method, it applies to anything: 587.518 - The first is to deconstruct the skill. 591.363 - Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done, 596.262 - and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces. 602.072 - Most of the things that we think of as skills 606.042 - are actually big bundles of skills that require all sorts of different things. 610.639 - The more you can break apart the skill, 614.211 - the more you're able to decide, 616.583 - what are the parts of this skill that would actually help me 618.974 - get to what I want? 621.365 - And then you can practice those first. 623.758 - And if you practice the most important things first, 625.96 - you'll be able to improve your performance 628.731 - in the least amount of time possible. 631.502 - The second is, learn enough to self correct. 634.273 - So, get three to five resources about what it is you're trying to learn. 638.467 - Could be book, could be DVDs, could be courses, could be anything. 643.719 - But don't use those as a way to procrastinate on practice. 648.95 - I know I do this, right? 650.585 - Get like 20 books about the topic, like, 652.661 - \"I'm going to start learning how to program a computer 655.138 - when I complete these 20 books\". 657.615 - No. That's procrastination. 660.094 - What you want to do is learn just enough 664.141 - that you can actually practice 665.85 - and self correct or self edit as you practice. 670.914 - So the learning becomes a way of getting better 673.819 - at noticing when you're making a mistake 676.724 - and then doing something a little different. 679.63 - The third is to remove barriers to practice. 684.106 - Distractions, television, internet. 686.55 - All of these things that get in the way 689.929 - of you actually sitting down and doing the work. 693.308 - And the more you're able to use just a little bit of willpower 696.689 - to remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing, 699.887 - the more likely you are to actually sit down and practice, right? 706.27 - And the fourth is to practice for at least 20 hours. 711.473 - Now, most skills have what I call a frustration barrier. 714.77 - You know, the grossly-incompetent- and-knowing-it part? 718.078 - That's really, really frustrating. We don't like to feel stupid. 722.374 - And feeling stupid is a barrier to us  actually sitting down and doing the work. 727.314 - So, by pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do 731.762 - for at least 20 hours, 734.378 - you will be able to overcome that initial frustration barrier 738.918 - and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards. 743.029 - That's it! It's not rocket science. 745.368 - Four very simple steps that you can use to learn anything. 751.466 - Now, this is easy to talk about in theory, 755.302 - but it's more fun to talk about in practice. 757.703 - So one of the things that I've wanted to learn how to do for a long time 761.964 - is play the ukulele. 764.163 - Has anybody seen Jake Shimabukuro's TEDTalk 767.787 - where he plays the ukulele and makes it sound like -- 770.901 - he's like a ukulele god. 772.26 - It's amazing. 774.026 - I saw it, I was like, \"That is so cool!\" 777.206 - It's such a neat instrument. I would really like to learn how to play. 781.373 - And so I decided that to test this theory 783.96 - I wanted to put 20 hours into practicing ukulele 787.636 - and see where it got. 789.819 - And so the first thing about playing the ukulele is, 793.635 - in order to practice, you have to have one, right? 797.701 - So, I got an ukulele and -- My lovely assistant? 801.791 - (Laughter) 804.526 - Thank you sir. I think I need the chord here. 811.58 - It's not just an ukulele, it's an electric ukulele. (Laughter) 815.569 - Yeah. 820.635 - So, the first couple hours are just like the first couple hours of anything. 825.195 - You have to get the tools that you are using to practice. 828.554 - You have to make sure they're available. 830.616 - My ukulele didn't come with strings attached. 832.582 - I had to figure out how to put those on. 834.548 - Like, that's kind of important, right? 836.515 - And learning how to tune, learning how to make sure 838.468 - that all of the things that need to be done 840.321 - in order to start practicing get done, right? 844.515 - Now, one of the things when I was ready to actually start practicing 851.187 - was I looked in online databases and songbooks for how to play songs. 855.996 - And they say, okay, ukuleles, you can play more than one string at a time, 859.088 - so you can play chords, that's cool, 860.969 - you are accompanying yourself, yay you. (Laughter) 864.242 - And when I started looking at songs, 868.356 - I had an ukulele chord book that had like hundreds of chords. 872.471 - Looking at this and \"Wow, that's intimidating\". 875.534 - But when you look at the actual songs, 877.859 - you see the same chords over and over, right? 882.71 - As it turns out, playing the ukulele is kind of like doing anything, 886.299 - There's a very small set of things that are really important 889.552 - and techniques that you'll use all the time. 892.422 - And in most songs you'll use four, maybe five chords, 898.42 - and that's it, that's the song. 900.229 - You don't have to know hundreds, as long as you know the four or the five. 904.993 - So, while I was doing my research, 906.813 - I found a wonderful little medley of pop songs 911.264 - by a band called Axis of Awesome. (Whistles) 916.178 - -- Somebody knows it. -- 919.199 - And what Axis of Awesome says is that you can learn, 923.418 - or you can play pretty much any pop song of the past five decades, 927.017 - if you know four chords, 928.685 - and those chords are G, D, Em and C. 933.062 - Four chords pump out every pop song ever, right? 937.931 - So I thought, this is cool! 939.401 - I would like to play every pop song ever. (Laughter) 942.584 - So, that was the first song I decided to learn, 945.627 - and I would like to actually share it with you. Ready? 949.445 - (Applause) Alright. 951.423 - (Music) 963.6 - (Singing) Just a small town girl, 966.104 - living in a lonely world, 968.878 - she took the midnight train going anywhere. 974.652 - I heard that you settled down, (Laughter) 978.209 - that you found a girl, 981.672 - that you're married now. 985.013 - Every night in my dreams (Laughter) 987.323 - I see you, I feel you, 990.496 - that is how I know you go on. (Laughter) 996.253 - I won't hesitate no more, no more. It cannot wait, I'm yours. 1002.227 - 'Cause you were amazing, we did amazing things. 1007.6 - If I could, then I would, I'd go wherever you will -- 1012.682 - Can you feel the love tonight. (Laughter) 1018.244 - I can't live with or without you. 1023.4 - When I find myself -- 1025.19 - When I find myself in times of trouble, mother Mary comes to me, 1027.489 - Sometimes I feel like I don't have partner. No woman, no cry. 1031.865 - Yeah mama, this surely is a dream. 1033.504 - I come from a land down under. (Laughter) 1035.836 - Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong. 1038.863 - Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, (Laughter) 1042.253 - but here's my number, so call me 1046.413 - Hey sexy lady, op, op, op, op, oppan gangnam style. (Laughter) 1050.19 - It's time to say goodbye. 1055.932 - Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end. 1065.79 - (Singing and music ends) (Applause) 1076.911 - Thank you, thank you. 1083.013 - I love that song. (Laughter) 1087.395 - And I have a secret to share with you. 1090.499 - So, by playing that song for you, 1094.471 - I just hit my twentieth hour of practicing the ukulele. 1099.221 - (Applause) Thank you. 1104.933 - And so it's amazing, pretty much anything that you can think of, 1108.974 - what do you want to do. 1110.752 - The major barrier to learn something new is not intellectual, 1115.317 - it's not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things. 1120.998 - The major barrier's emotional. We're scared. 1124.753 - Feeling stupid doesn't feel good, 1127.014 - in the beginning of learning anything new 1129.275 - you feel really stupid. 1131.537 - So the major barrier's not intellectual, it's emotional. 1135.633 - But put 20 hours into anything. 1138.971 - It doesn't matter. What do you want to learn? 1141.377 - Do you want to learn a language? Want to learn how to cook? 1144.848 - Want to learn how to draw? 1147.114 - What turns you on? What lights you up? 1150.86 - Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20 hours. 1154.747 - Have fun. 1156.093 - (Applause)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: Life-Changing Parenthood 1:15 - The Challenges of Learning as a Busy Parent 3:40 - The Myth of the 10,000-Hour Rule 5:30 - The Origins of the 10,000-Hour Rule 7:30 - The True Path to Skill Acquisition 9:40 - The 20-Hour Learning Method 11:00 - Steps to Learn Any Skill Quickly 13:15 - Putting the Method to Practice: Learning Ukulele 15:30 - The Emotional Barrier to Learning 17:00 - Closing Thoughts: What Will You Learn?"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Generate the timestamps by following these rules: 1) I need only titles and timestamps 2)Timestamps should be on the left before the title 3)Convert the timestamps to minutes, in transcripts they are in seconds (Example: 341.28 seconds = 5:41 (5 minutes and 41 seconds), only chapter them into 10 or fewer chapters(Does have to be 10, if it lasts less than 10 minutes long, generate less than 10 chapters) Transcripts:0.36 - It's been 6 months since I purchased a\u00a0 pair of the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. I,\u00a0\u00a0 5.72 - like a lot of people looking at\u00a0 getting these, had some questions like:\u00a0\u00a0 9.64 - What is the point of these if you're not an\u00a0 Instagram influencer or you just don't care\u00a0\u00a0 14.16 - about posting to social media? And would I\u00a0 use them enough to justify the cost? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 19.52 - 6 months later, I now know\u00a0 the answer to both questions. 25.04 - So the first highlight of these glasses is\u00a0 their design. Meta and Ray-Ban have done\u00a0\u00a0 30.4 - something pretty remarkable here. They've created\u00a0 a wearable that looks like something people are\u00a0\u00a0 35.52 - already wearing. I have walked by and talked\u00a0 with countless people over the past 6 months\u00a0\u00a0 40.84 - while wearing these glasses, and like one person\u00a0 realized what they actually were. The only real\u00a0\u00a0 46.92 - giveaway is the camera, and the sides are\u00a0 slightly thicker. Meta Ray-Bans come in a\u00a0\u00a0 52.28 - few different styles: Headliner, Wayfarer (which\u00a0 is what I have), and a couple others. And yes,\u00a0\u00a0 58.52 - you can get them with prescription lenses,\u00a0 and you can even get transition lenses,\u00a0\u00a0 63.84 - either prescription or non-prescription,\u00a0 though they'll cost you an extra $50 to $80. 69.96 - So how exactly do these work and\u00a0 what makes them smart glasses? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 74.76 - they have an integrated camera, they have\u00a0 open-ear speakers on each side of the glasses,\u00a0\u00a0 80.92 - and they have the Meta AI built into them.\u00a0 In terms of controls, you've got a capture\u00a0\u00a0 85.72 - button on the top right for photos and videos,\u00a0 a touchpad on the right side for volume control,\u00a0\u00a0 91.28 - skipping tracks, and triggering the assistant,\u00a0 and you can even use them to trigger Spotify,\u00a0\u00a0 96.04 - Apple Music, or Amazon Music\u00a0 with a single tap. Also note,\u00a0\u00a0 100.08 - Apple Music is only available on the\u00a0 iPhone version of The Meta View app. 104.76 - The glasses come with an IPX4 water resistance\u00a0 rating, so you don't have to worry if you get\u00a0\u00a0 110.36 - caught in light rain, and I was able to\u00a0 wear them out kayaking in the Sound with\u00a0\u00a0 114.76 - no problem. You just wipe them off after\u00a0 they get a bit wet, though note they're\u00a0\u00a0 119.16 - not designed to stay in the rain or sustain\u00a0 splashes for hours or anything like that. 126.32 - Now, one of the most crucial aspects of the\u00a0 glasses is the speakers. The sound quality is\u00a0\u00a0 132.4 - surprisingly decent. I found over the past 6\u00a0 months that I've reached for my earbuds a bit\u00a0\u00a0 138.48 - less while wearing these, especially when all I'm\u00a0 looking for is just some background music. One of\u00a0\u00a0 144.16 - my favorite use cases is transitioning music\u00a0 playing from my car to the glasses with just a\u00a0\u00a0 149.52 - single tap. The glasses also have a five-mic\u00a0 system, which is excellent for phone calls. 155.68 - All right, and this is how the mic\u00a0 sounds for the Meta Ray-Bans. Let me\u00a0\u00a0 160.4 - know what you think in the comments.\u00a0 How do you think these mics sound? 164.28 - So the AI thing, what exactly can\u00a0 Meta AI and this assistant do? Well,\u00a0\u00a0 170.56 - I'd break it down into two categories. One\u00a0 is more task-oriented. This is going to be\u00a0\u00a0 176.0 - more familiar to you if you're familiar\u00a0 with like Apple and Google's assistants.\u00a0\u00a0 180.12 - So that's things like hands-free phone calls, you\u00a0 can ask these to take a photo for you, send a text\u00a0\u00a0 186.24 - message to somebody in your contacts, play music,\u00a0 and more. You can also use it to send messages to\u00a0\u00a0 192.04 - your contacts in both WhatsApp and Messenger,\u00a0 or add videos directly to your Instagram Story. 198.36 - The second thing the AI assistant is for\u00a0 is having general conversations with,\u00a0\u00a0 203.24 - and you can pretty much ask it anything like\u00a0 general search queries. So, for example,\u00a0\u00a0 209.12 - here: \"What zones do pawpaw trees grow in?\" 214.56 - Pawpaw trees can grow in Raleigh, North Carolina,\u00a0\u00a0 217.6 - as it falls within USDA zone 8,\u00a0 which is suitable for their growth. 224.32 - There you go. It'll even do proactive things for\u00a0 you with the media quality check feature. It'll\u00a0\u00a0 229.8 - tell you when someone in a photo has their face\u00a0 covered by hair or if your camera lens is dirty. 235.8 - And speaking of the camera, that's where things on\u00a0 these glasses get really interesting. The glasses\u00a0\u00a0 241.2 - pack a 12-megapixel camera, and while that might\u00a0 not sound impressive in the age of 50-megapixel\u00a0\u00a0 247.32 - smartphone camera sensors, the quality is\u00a0 surprisingly good. The colors are pretty accurate,\u00a0\u00a0 253.4 - and the HDR processing doesn't go overboard\u00a0 like it does on many modern smartphone cameras. 259.68 - What's really cool about having a camera in\u00a0 your glasses is the unique vantage point,\u00a0\u00a0 264.72 - like when I was kayaking in The Sound. The Meta\u00a0 Ray-Bans were perfect for capturing moments when\u00a0\u00a0 269.84 - I was on the water, or even when we kayaked to an\u00a0 island in the middle of the sound and my brother\u00a0\u00a0 275.12 - found this little shrimp in his boat. In the\u00a0 amount of time I would have spent fumbling for\u00a0\u00a0 279.76 - my phone, I would have missed capturing that\u00a0 moment that I was able to with the glasses. 285.6 - Now, will these replace your smartphone\u00a0 camera or fancy dedicated camera? No,\u00a0\u00a0 290.56 - not for serious photography at least, but for\u00a0 capturing spontaneous moments or when you're\u00a0\u00a0 295.68 - in situations where using other cameras isn't\u00a0 practical, that's where the Meta Ray-Bans shine. 301.92 - There are some constraints though to keep\u00a0 in mind with this camera system. Videos\u00a0\u00a0 306.6 - are limited to 3 minutes, though I\u00a0 usually keep mine at 60 seconds to\u00a0\u00a0 310.84 - conserve battery. Another limitation of the\u00a0 camera system is the aspect ratio for both\u00a0\u00a0 316.48 - photos and videos. It's fixed in a portrait\u00a0 orientation, which might not always be ideal. 323.2 - Now, what about battery life and how do you\u00a0 charge the glasses? The glasses come with\u00a0\u00a0 328.08 - this nice leather Ray-Ban case that doubles as\u00a0 a charger. There's a USB-C port on the bottom,\u00a0\u00a0 334.36 - and the glasses themselves charge via pin\u00a0 connectors in the nose bridge. Meta claims\u00a0\u00a0 339.4 - 4 hours of battery life on a single charge and\u00a0 up to 36 hours with the case. In my experience,\u00a0\u00a0 345.92 - that's been pretty accurate. I took these on a\u00a0 day trip to Cape Lookout, and they lasted about\u00a0\u00a0 351.36 - between 4 and 5 hours, and I was taking a lot of\u00a0 photos and videos. They're also pretty quick to\u00a0\u00a0 357.6 - recharge. You'll get about 30 to 40% capacity\u00a0 with just a 15-minute charge in the case. 364.64 - So what features have I found myself not really\u00a0 using with these glasses? While I use the Meta\u00a0\u00a0 370.16 - assistant for basic tasks like controlling\u00a0 media, phone calls, etc., I haven't found\u00a0\u00a0 374.68 - myself using its deeper capabilities like\u00a0 having conversations with it or asking it\u00a0\u00a0 379.76 - to identify what you're looking at. I have tried\u00a0 that feature a lot, especially when it first came\u00a0\u00a0 384.48 - out. I tried to use it to identify what kind of\u00a0 tree am I looking at, and it would just tell me,\u00a0\u00a0 389.96 - \"You're looking at a tree with green leaves,\" and\u00a0 I'm like, \"Okay, thanks, that was not helpful.\" 394.84 - I also haven't used the direct sharing features\u00a0 much. It's there if you want it, but it hasn't\u00a0\u00a0 400.0 - been a go-to for me since outside of my job, I\u00a0 don't post or check social media all that often. 407.04 - So what are the downsides I've encountered while\u00a0 using the Meta Ray-Bans? The main one involves the\u00a0\u00a0 412.36 - Meta AI assistant. It just has some limitations.\u00a0 It couldn't identify songs currently playing off\u00a0\u00a0 419.2 - my iPhone, and it won't let you directly reply\u00a0 to a text that it's reading aloud. And when you\u00a0\u00a0 425.16 - ask it to play a song on Apple Music, it'll play\u00a0 that song but nothing after it. The integration\u00a0\u00a0 430.68 - with your phone's operating system isn't as\u00a0 seamless as you want it to be, and it really\u00a0\u00a0 434.8 - makes me curious how much better the experience\u00a0 would be if these glasses were made by Apple or\u00a0\u00a0 440.44 - Google. And it also makes you aware of how locked\u00a0 down these phone operating systems still are. 446.8 - Also, because Meta AI is a large language learning\u00a0 model like ChatGPT and all of these other chatbots\u00a0\u00a0 452.68 - out there, it can just confidently lie\u00a0 to you when it gives you an answer,\u00a0\u00a0 457.92 - which makes the being able to ask\u00a0 it just for information that feature\u00a0\u00a0 463.4 - a bit useless because I don't trust it\u00a0 to actually give me the correct answer. 468.08 - Battery life is another downside. I\u00a0 think closer to 8 hours would be ideal,\u00a0\u00a0 472.76 - especially for long days where you're\u00a0 outside and you don't necessarily want\u00a0\u00a0 476.32 - to have to put the glasses back in\u00a0 their case to charge for 15 minutes. 480.68 - Another downside is when taking photos, there's\u00a0 a slight 1 to 2 second delay when you press the\u00a0\u00a0 486.84 - button and when the photo is actually taken,\u00a0 which can be frustrating because people will\u00a0\u00a0 491.88 - often think you already took the photo and start\u00a0 moving before the photo has actually been snapped. 497.08 - The last downside with these glasses is while\u00a0 they are comfortable, if you wear them for\u00a0\u00a0 501.24 - several hours, I've at least noticed that my\u00a0 ears will get a little bit sore as you kind\u00a0\u00a0 505.6 - of just feel the weight of them a little bit.\u00a0 And while it's not sore enough to make me not\u00a0\u00a0 510.88 - want to wear these as sunglasses, not at all, but\u00a0 I do still hope that Meta and Ray-Ban are able to\u00a0\u00a0 516.96 - make these a little bit lighter and the sides\u00a0 a little bit slimmer in the next generation. 522.56 - So would I recommend getting a pair of the Meta\u00a0 Ray-Ban smart glasses? I was skeptical at first,\u00a0\u00a0 528.32 - but these glasses have genuinely surprised\u00a0 me. They're great for trips, adventures,\u00a0\u00a0 533.32 - or just capturing everyday moments. The\u00a0 camera quality is decent considering it's\u00a0\u00a0 538.52 - built into a pair of sunglasses, and the overall\u00a0 experience of using them is just fun. So yes,\u00a0\u00a0 545.6 - I would recommend them, but for whom, you may ask? 548.44 - Well, if you're the type of person who\u00a0 just loses sunglasses really easily,\u00a0\u00a0 553.88 - these probably are not for you. Unlike items\u00a0 like AirPods, there's no Find My or tracking\u00a0\u00a0 559.6 - these if they get lost, and since there's no\u00a0 fingerprint sensor or other authentication\u00a0\u00a0 564.44 - method for the glasses, they'd be pretty\u00a0 easy for thieves to steal and reuse.\u00a0\u00a0 569.68 - That's something Meta should\u00a0 definitely address in future versions. 573.32 - How I look at these is if you're already in the\u00a0 market for a pair of $200 designer sunglasses,\u00a0\u00a0 579.16 - well, for just $100 more, you get\u00a0 an integrated camera, speakers,\u00a0\u00a0 583.64 - and an assistant, and to me,\u00a0 that's a pretty easy upsell. 588.4 - Now another question a lot of people ask when\u00a0 looking at these is should you get the version\u00a0\u00a0 592.56 - with transition lenses so you can just keep\u00a0 wearing them as you come inside? That depends\u00a0\u00a0 598.12 - on two things: One, you prefer noise cancellation\u00a0 when you're inside working and/or taking calls,\u00a0\u00a0 603.36 - and two, how much do you think you'll really\u00a0 benefit from having the integrated Meta\u00a0\u00a0 608.32 - AI assistant? If you're in a noisy\u00a0 environment or just an environment\u00a0\u00a0 611.76 - you want that noise cancellation and you\u00a0 don't care about the AI features as much,\u00a0\u00a0 616.04 - then I'd say just go for the sunglasses\u00a0 version of these and save yourself some money. 620.8 - All in all, I've really come to enjoy the Meta\u00a0 Ray-Ban smart glasses. They're one of the best\u00a0\u00a0 625.36 - wearables you can get that offer real value and\u00a0 utility today. I only wish they could be more\u00a0\u00a0 631.32 - integrated with my phone and have slightly better\u00a0 battery life, but it makes me really hopeful for\u00a0\u00a0 636.92 - the future of this category. Where these are today\u00a0 is already pretty impressive, and I can't imagine\u00a0\u00a0 643.28 - all the things you'd be able to do with these\u00a0 if they had embedded displays. For now though,\u00a0\u00a0 648.36 - I'm content just listening to music on these,\u00a0 taking photos and videos, and sending someone an\u00a0\u00a0 654.24 - occasional text or taking a call from my glasses,\u00a0 which is a pretty cool thing you can do now. 661.56 - I've left links to learn more about these\u00a0 glasses and check their current price in\u00a0\u00a0 665.36 - the blog post for this video at 6monthslater.net.\u00a0 Link in the description.

22.977 - Actually, you should probably  make dinner first. 25.521 - You usually like cooking, 27.148 - though it\u2019s hard to enjoy with this work hanging over your head, 30.568 - and oh\u2014 it\u2019s actually pretty late! 33.863 - Maybe you should just try again in the morning? 36.866 - This is the cycle of procrastination, and I promise you, we have all been there. 44.082 - But why do we keep procrastinating  even when we know it\u2019s bad for us? 49.962 - To be clear, putting something off isn\u2019t always procrastinating. 54.884 - Responsible time management requires deciding which tasks are important 59.388 - and which ones can wait. 61.057 - Procrastination is when we avoid a task  we said we would do, for no good reason, 66.729 - despite expecting our behavior  to bring negative consequences. 70.65 - Obviously, it\u2019s irrational to do something you expect to harm you. 75.238 - But ironically, procrastination is the  result of our bodies trying to protect us, 81.869 - specifically by avoiding a task  we see as threatening. 86.999 - When you realize you need to write that report, 89.585 - your brain responds like it would to any incoming threat. 93.798 - Your amygdala, a set of neurons  involved in emotional processing 97.885 - and threat identification, 99.637 - releases hormones including adrenaline that kick off a fear response. 105.309 - This stress-induced panic can overpower the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, 110.773 - which typically help you think  long term and regulate your emotions. 115.069 - And it\u2019s in the midst of this fight, flight, or freeze response 119.198 - that you decide to handle the threat 121.117 - by avoiding it in favor of some less stressful task. 125.329 - This response might seem extreme\u2014 128.124 - after all, it\u2019s just a deadline, not a bear attack. 131.335 - But we\u2019re most likely to procrastinate tasks that evoke negative feelings, 136.257 - such as dread, incompetence, and insecurity. 140.136 - Studies of procrastinating university students have found participants 144.473 - were more likely to put off tasks they perceived as stressful or challenging. 149.478 - And the perception of how difficult the task is 152.356 - increases while you\u2019re putting it off. 155.776 - In one experiment, students were given reminders to study throughout the day. 161.115 - While they were studying, most reported that it wasn\u2019t so bad. 164.785 - But when they were procrastinating, 166.787 - they consistently rated the idea of studying as very stressful, 171.918 - making it difficult to get started. 175.004 - Because procrastination is motivated by our negative feelings, 178.799 - some individuals are more susceptible to it than others. 182.762 - People who have difficulty regulating their emotions 185.473 - and those who struggle  with low self-esteem 188.017 - are much more likely to procrastinate, 190.686 - regardless of how good they are at time management. 194.148 - However, it's a common misconception that all procrastinators are lazy. 200.529 - In the body and brain, laziness is marked by no energy and general apathy. 206.786 - When you\u2019re feeling lazy, you\u2019re more likely to sit around doing nothing 210.456 - than distract yourself  with unimportant tasks. 213.876 - In fact, many people procrastinate because they care too much. 219.298 - Procrastinators often report a high fear of failure, 223.052 - putting things off because they\u2019re afraid their work 225.846 - won\u2019t live up to their high standards. 228.808 - Whatever the reason for procrastination,  the results are often the same. 233.813 - Frequent procrastinators are likely  to suffer from anxiety and depression, 238.484 - ongoing feelings of shame, 240.319 - higher stress levels and physical ailments associated with high stress. 245.866 - Worst of all, while procrastination hurts us in the long run, 249.787 - it does temporarily reduce our stress level, 253.457 - reinforcing it as a bodily response for coping with stressful tasks. 258.963 - So, how can we break the cycle of procrastination? 263.843 - Traditionally, people thought  procrastinators needed to cultivate 267.513 - discipline and practice  strict time management. 271.183 - But today, many researchers feel the exact opposite. 275.479 - Being too hard on yourself can layer additional bad emotions onto a task, 280.192 - making the threat even more intense. 283.404 - To short-circuit this stress response, 285.698 - we need to address and reduce these negative emotions. 290.619 - Some simple strategies include breaking a task into smaller elements 295.249 - or journaling about why it's stressing you out 297.835 - and addressing those underlying concerns. 301.464 - Try removing nearby distractions that make it easy to impulsively procrastinate. 307.136 - And more than anything, it helps to cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, 312.099 - forgiving yourself, and making a plan to do better next time. 317.188 - Because a culture that perpetuates this cycle of stress and procrastination 322.151 - hurts all of us in the long term."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Timestamps: 0:00 - Introduction: The Cycle of Procrastination 0:36 - What is Procrastination?

3.526 - In this video I'm gonna be sharing 5.117 - my top seven tips comin' up. 8.013 - (shutter clicks) 12.352 - Hey what's up guys, Sean here with Think Media TV. 13.793 - Help you go further, faster in media. 16.706 - And on this channel we do tech gear reviews, 18.582 - video gear reviews, and q and a episodes just like this one. 22.315 - So if you're new here, consider subscribing. 24.878 - Let's get into the video. 28.515 - Gabriel asked \"I am starting a tech channel on YouTube 31.128 - but I don't how to stand out and be original, any tips?\" 35.128 - Thanks so much for the question, Gabriel. 36.681 - So my first initial thoughts when it comes 38.345 - to starting a tech channel on YouTube 40.014 - are that, it is a pretty competitive space. 43.305 - And if you look around it can seem like 45.3 - there's tech channels everywhere 46.931 - and new ones starting every day. 48.338 - But, in my opinion, I still feel like 51.799 - there is a ton of room for starting a tech channel. 55.087 - And these tips are really gonna help. 56.946 - Probably the biggest eye opener for me 58.888 - is that every year I go to CES, 61.499 - the Consumer Electronic Show in Vegas, and NAB, 65.187 - the National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. 68.606 - So much different tech, with new companies, 71.157 - new brands, popping up every single day. 74.272 - And in my experience, there is like not enough 77.054 - tech YouTubers to go around, to cover everything 80.918 - that's happening in the space. 82.927 - And so if you have a passion to do it all, 85.111 - yes it is competitive, but if you do some best practices 87.912 - I really believe you can crush it. 90.58 - So tip number one, start. 92.243 - I know it seems basic, but to start a tech channel 94.617 - you have to start a tech channel. 97.594 - Was that tweetable? 98.62 - But within that, be you, what you don't need to do 101.476 - is copy somebody else in the space. 103.607 - The space does not need another 104.942 - unboxed therapy, another NKBHD, it needs you. 108.903 - So be authentic, be original, and create 110.985 - the kind of channel and videos 113.982 - that you yourself would wanna see. 115.872 - 'Cause that's your unique perspective. 117.858 - That's your unique two cents, and people are gonna 120.544 - connect with you the most when you are yourself. 124.305 - And then also, play to your strengths. 125.886 - And so don't try to be something 127.598 - outside of what your strengths are. 129.287 - But play to what your strengths are. 131.471 - I don't do a lot of mobile phone reviews, 133.859 - or really any on this channel. 135.421 - I don't really talk about droids or anything like that. 137.317 - I play to the strengths of being a video creator, 139.97 - a video influencer, having a long history 141.996 - of video production, and helping you find 144.163 - the best tools for people making videos. 147.482 - And so what are your strengths? 148.826 - Build your tech channel around that. 151.744 - Tip number two, niche down or niche for the global audience. 155.846 - In online marketing that says the riches are in the niches. 160.064 - And really what that means, is that if you try 162.194 - to reach everybody, you'll really end up reaching nobody. 165.567 - So I would suggest that you don't 167.007 - make a general tech channel, but you pick 170.165 - something specific, all android, tablets, drones, 173.518 - point and shoot, maybe consumer 176.279 - type cameras and mobile accessories. 179.069 - Laptops or all PC and graphics car--I mean 181.723 - there's so many different aspects of the tech space. 184.585 - Find one where, that's maybe underserved a little bit 187.07 - and then find one that aligns with your expertise. 189.328 - As I said, my passion on this particular channel 192.02 - is to really connect the audio, cameras, lighting, 197.081 - accessories for the hustling video creators like yourself. 201.073 - So at NAB, I don't really go towards 203.303 - the broadcast cameras, the higher end, $25,000 cameras, 207.17 - because that's not practical for every day 209.344 - video creators and video influencers like yourselves. 212.945 - And so, what is your niche? 215.553 - Focus on that and build your channel in a specific area. 219.772 - Tip number three is where to get 221.622 - products to make your videos about. 223.97 - And what I would recommend is that 225.175 - if you do this around your strengths and your passion, 227.3 - I would review the stuff you already have. 229.699 - And one of the things that I did was, 231.569 - when I started even ThinkMediaTV, 234.02 - I was doing wedding videos, I was doing videos about DSLRs, 238.928 - and that was stuff that I got because I had 240.314 - a video production business, and so I started kind of 244.333 - with what I was already doing. 246.955 - And, don't be afraid to invest early on. 249.343 - Again, all of that early stuff I bought 251.555 - because of my video production business, 253.441 - and because I was making income other places. 255.956 - I know some people, they even, they'll work at best buy 257.514 - or something, and then they'll be able to really 260.679 - fuel and fund their tech habit on their own 264.713 - as they're building their channel. 267.038 - Tip number four, is be consistent 268.598 - and build a library of videos. 271.506 - Eventually you're gonna be able to start getting free stuff, 273.832 - working with brands and connecting with people. 276.073 - But they need to see that you've been consistent. 278.279 - And so post consistently, post regularly. 281.876 - I recommend that once a week is a minimum. 284.791 - And build up a library. 286.012 - If you have a ten video playlist 288.576 - of products that you've reviewed, 290.596 - you could share that with brands or companies 292.715 - and they can see you're good for it. 294.739 - They can see that you're doing the work, 296.054 - they can see your past work, they can see that, 298.243 - they don't know that it was products 300.135 - you already have that you reviewed. 301.606 - They're like, Oh wow, other people 303.056 - are working with this channel, 304.9 - and then you can start to scale into working with brands. 308.081 - But you have to lay that foundation of being consistent. 311.39 - Tip number five, is work on your branding. 314.022 - I think that if you want to, not only impact 316.573 - and build an audience but also start having 318.9 - opportunities open, brand opportunities open 322.201 - and sponsorships and different things like that, 324.152 - you wanna have a solid brand. 325.517 - And so your avatar, your picture on YouTube, 328.63 - your cover image, all your thumbnails. 330.838 - The overall aesthetic of your channel 333.122 - should communicate the messaging that you wanna send, 336.289 - a professional message as well as your specific category. 340.162 - The way you're standing out, being unique, 343.512 - being different in the tech space. 345.723 - And you gotta start with whatever you have. 347.41 - So don't let any of these things hold you back. 349.324 - Just start, get better over time, 351.36 - but think about ways like how is your branding right now? 353.908 - Is it on point or could you update it a little bit. 356.862 - Make your branding as professional as possible. 360.001 - Always work on it to take it to another level. 362.746 - And it will not only impact your audience more 365.863 - but it'll also lead to opportunities. 368.03 - Tip number six, make it easy for brands to contact you. 370.95 - And don't hesitate to reach out to brands. 372.93 - So, number one, make sure that your about page on YouTube 376.838 - is filled out with a clear description 379.885 - about what your channel is about, how you're different. 382.39 - How your posting schedule, different things like that. 385.287 - And make sure that your business email is entered there. 389.021 - That's actually a place that brands 391.323 - will begin to contact you, and they will begin to ask 394.121 - of a good review products, they'll wanna 396.949 - send you free stuff and so fill that out 100%. 400.44 - Also don't hesitate to reach out to brands. 402.998 - And so I recommend, just like you have branding 405.788 - a point on your channel, then it also 407.966 - should be that way on social media. 409.905 - And so then that way you can potentially tweet a brand 412.165 - or you can email them and say 414.024 - \"Hey, do you guys ever work with YouTubers? 415.628 - If so, I am always looking for new content to make. 419.445 - I love your products and if you ever send out reviews copies 423.837 - or sample copies, let me know.\" 425.979 - And then they can get back to you. 427.916 - And recently, I just did that. 429.428 - It was amazon prime day, I saw something 431.335 - really cool that I'd never heard of. 432.759 - So I tweeted the company, they immediately tweeted back 435.242 - and said email this email address. 437.27 - And then boom, they sent me some stuff to review 439.104 - because I just initiated the conversation. 441.447 - But I would suggest that my twitter is on point 444.439 - showing that I'm kind of focused 446.653 - and I've got this focus on online video. 448.919 - And then they could also look at the channel 450.655 - and see that you've got a history 452.027 - and you've got branding happening there. 453.68 - And so, make it easy for brands to contact you. 456.007 - And then don't hesitate, once you have that foundation of 458.6 - consistency to reach out to brands you'd wanna work with. 461.858 - Tip number seven, and probably 464.373 - the most important in my opinion is hustle your face off. 468.618 - Yes, YouTube is a ton of work and starting 471.544 - a tech channel is definitely challenging. 474.641 - There's lots of rewards and there's lots 475.637 - of cool things about being on YouTube 479.068 - and getting free products and eventually making it your 481.637 - part-time or even full-time kind of like, career. 484.478 - But it, by no means is it easy. 487.192 - And so go into this knowing that 488.968 - you gotta pound the pavement. 490.526 - You gotta hustle. 492.048 - Everybody that started out doing this 494.635 - was doing it as a side hustle. 496.215 - Maybe you have a full-time job, 497.659 - maybe you have other stuff going on. 499.337 - You gotta do it in the margin times. 501.052 - You gotta do it on the weekends. 502.344 - You gotta take any second that you have 504.506 - to work on your branding, work on your channel, 506.699 - create new videos, connect with people on social media, 509.108 - reply to comments, do all the stuff that it takes to do, 512.827 - to build a YouTube channel over the long haul. 515.434 - Set your mind on, this isn't just a month-long sprint 517.609 - that you're gonna set out to do this 521.207 - for the next 12 to 24 months without looking up, 524.034 - grinding every single day, I believe that's what it takes. 527.936 - But I believe that if you really wanna do it, 530.079 - and if you're passionate about it, that you can do it. 532.803 - So start your tech channel, or start any channel 535.393 - that you're passionate about, and put in the hustle. 539.008 - The dream is free, the hustle is sold separately. 542.165 - Question of the day, Gabriel's question was 543.681 - how do I stand out and be original as a tech YouTuber?
